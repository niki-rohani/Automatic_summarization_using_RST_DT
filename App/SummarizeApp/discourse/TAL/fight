Look. The name of the movie is Fight Club. It's got bareknuckle fights in it. They're violent. They're bloody. Please don't come out of Fight Club whining about how violent and bloody it is. Got it?<s>
Sex and violence are two of the things people go to movies for. They aren't getting enough in their own lives.<s>
