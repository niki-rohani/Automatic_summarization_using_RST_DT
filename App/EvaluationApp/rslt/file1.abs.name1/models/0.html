<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Energetic and concrete action has been taken in Colombia during the past 60 days against the mafiosi of the drug trade, because, unfortunately, it came too late. Ten years ago, the newspaper El Espectador, began warning of the rise of the drug mafias and of their leaders' aspirations nothing was done The most ruthless dictatorships have not censored their press more brutally than the drug mafias censor Colombia's. In the past 10 years about 50 journalists have been silenced forever, murdered. Within the past two months a bomb exploded in the offices of the El Espectador in Bogota, destroying a major part of its installations and equipment. And only last week the newspaper Vanguardia Liberal in the city of Bucaramanga was bombed, and its installations destroyed. Journalists and their families are constantly threatened Distribution centers are bombed, and advertisers are intimidated. that the drug mafia's terrorism someday will extend to all the newspapers published in the free world. The solidarity of the uncensored media world-wide against drug terrorism is the only way The American people and their government also woke up too late to the menace drugs posed to the moral structure of their country. Colombia alone does not have the capacity to fight this battle successfully. All drug-consuming countries must jointly decide to combat and punish the consumers and distributors of drugs. The U.S., as the major drug consumer, should lead this joint effort. Reduction, if not the total cessation, of drug consumption is the requirement for victory. Much is being done in Colombia to fight the drug cartel mafia. Luxurious homes and ranches have been raided by the military authorities, and sophisticated and powerful communications equipment have been seized. More than 300 planes and helicopters have been impounded at airports, and a large number of vehicles and launches has been confiscated. The military has also captured enormous arsenals of powerful and sophisticated weapons, explosives and other war-like materiel. and public opinion decisively supports the government and the army -- but, on the other hand, none of the key drug barons have been captured. There has been a lot of talk that a large portion of the Colombian economy is sustained by the laundering of drug money. In my opinion, this is not true. Laundered drug money has served only to increase, unrealistically, the price of real estate, creating serious problems for low-income people Drug money has also gone to buy expensive cars, airplanes, launches and nightclubs But most of the drug money is kept in investments and in financial institutions outside Colombia. In fact, the cooperation of those financial institutions is essential to the success of the drug battle. The price of coffee has gone down almost 45% since the beginning of the year, to the lowest level Market conditions point to even lower prices next year. Our coffee growers face reductions in their income, and this tempts them to contemplate substituting coca crops for coffee. -- cut flowers -- A just price and an open market for what Colombian produces and exports should be the policy of the U.S.</a></body></html>
