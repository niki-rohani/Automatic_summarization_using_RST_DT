Energetic and concrete action has been taken in Colombia during the past 60 days against the mafiosi of the drug trade,<s>
but it has not been sufficiently effective,<s>
because, unfortunately, it came too late.<s>
Ten years ago, the newspaper El Espectador,<s>
of which my brother Guillermo was editor,<s>
began warning of the rise of the drug mafias and of their leaders' aspirations<s>
to control Colombian politics, especially the Congress.<s>
Then,<s>
when it would have been easier to resist them,<s>
nothing was done<s>
and my brother was murdered by the drug mafias three years ago.<s>
The most ruthless dictatorships have not censored their press more brutally than the drug mafias censor Colombia's.<s>
The censorship is enforced through terrorism and assassination.<s>
In the past 10 years about 50 journalists have been silenced forever, murdered.<s>
Within the past two months a bomb exploded in the offices of the El Espectador in Bogota,<s>
destroying a major part of its installations and equipment.<s>
And only last week the newspaper Vanguardia Liberal in the city of Bucaramanga was bombed,<s>
and its installations destroyed.<s>
Journalists and their families are constantly threatened<s>
as are the newspaper distribution outlets.<s>
Distribution centers are bombed,<s>
and advertisers are intimidated.<s>
Censorship is imposed by terrorism.<s>
If the Colombian media accept this new and hideous censorship<s>
there is little doubt<s>
that the drug mafia's terrorism someday will extend to all the newspapers<s>
published in the free world.<s>
The solidarity of the uncensored media world-wide against drug terrorism is the only way<s>
press freedom can survive.<s>
The American people and their government also woke up too late to the menace<s>
drugs posed to the moral structure of their country.<s>
Even now, the American attack upon this tremendous problem is timid in relation to the magnitude of the threat.<s>
I can attest<s>
that a recent Colombian visitor to the U.S. was offered drugs three times in the few blocks' walk between Grand Central Terminal and the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in midtown Manhattan.<s>
Colombia alone<s>
-- its government, its people, its newspapers--<s>
does not have the capacity<s>
to fight this battle successfully.<s>
All drug-consuming countries must jointly decide to combat and punish the consumers and distributors of drugs.<s>
The U.S., as the major drug consumer, should lead this joint effort.<s>
Reduction, if not the total cessation, of drug consumption is the requirement for victory.<s>
Much is being done in Colombia<s>
to fight the drug cartel mafia.<s>
Luxurious homes and ranches have been raided by the military authorities,<s>
and sophisticated and powerful communications equipment have been seized.<s>
More than 300 planes and helicopters have been impounded at airports,<s>
and a large number of vehicles and launches has been confiscated.<s>
The military has also captured enormous arsenals of powerful and sophisticated weapons, explosives and other war-like materiel.<s>
Much has been accomplished<s>
and public opinion decisively supports the government and the army<s>
-- but, on the other hand, none of the key drug barons have been captured.<s>
There has been a lot of talk<s>
that a large portion of the Colombian economy is sustained by the laundering of drug money.<s>
In my opinion, this is not true.<s>
Laundered drug money has served only to increase, unrealistically, the price of real estate,<s>
creating serious problems for low-income people<s>
who aspire to own their own homes.<s>
Drug money has also gone<s>
to buy expensive cars, airplanes, launches and nightclubs<s>
where drugs are consumed.<s>
But most of the drug money is kept in investments and in financial institutions outside Colombia.<s>
In fact, the cooperation of those financial institutions is essential to the success of the drug battle.<s>
What is of much more importance to the Colombian economy than the supposed benefits of laundered drug money is higher prices for Colombia 's legitimate products.<s>
The price of coffee has gone down almost 45% since the beginning of the year, to the lowest level<s>
(after inflation)<s>
since the Great Depression.<s>
Market conditions point to even lower prices next year.<s>
The 27-year-old coffee cartel had to be formally dissolved this summer.<s>
As a result, Colombia will earn $500 million less from its coffee this year than last.<s>
Our coffee growers face reductions in their income,<s>
and this tempts them to contemplate substituting coca crops for coffee.<s>
U.S. interests occasionally try to impose barriers to the import of another important Colombian export<s>
-- cut flowers --<s>
into the American market.<s>
A just price and an open market<s>
for what Colombian produces and exports<s>
should be the policy of the U.S.<s>
I take advantage of this opportunity<s>
given to me by The Wall Street Journal<s>
to make a plea to the millions of readers of this newspaper,<s>
to become soldiers<s>
dedicated to the fight against the use of drugs.<s>
Each gram of cocaine consumed is a deadly bullet against those in our country and in the rest of the world<s>
who fight this terrible scourge.<s>
A crusade of NO to the consumption of drugs is imperative.<s>
