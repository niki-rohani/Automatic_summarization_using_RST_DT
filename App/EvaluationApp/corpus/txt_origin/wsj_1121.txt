Early this century, diamond mining in the magnificent dunes <s>
where the Namib Desert meets the Atlantic Ocean <s>
was a day at the beach. <s>
Men would crawl in the sand <s>
looking for shiny stones. <s>
It was as easy <s>
as collecting sea shells at Malibu. <s>
Men are still combing the beach with shovels and hand brushes, <s>
searching for that unusual glint. <s>
But only after a fleet of 336 gargantuan earthmoving vehicles <s>
belonging to De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the world's diamond kingpins, <s>
do their work. <s>
Last year, 43 million tons of desert were moved from one dune to another <s>
to recover 934,242 carats, <s>
which comes to 46 tons of sand per carat, or one-fifth gram. <s>
Oh yes, the Atlantic was also pushed back 300 yards. <s>
"If there's diamonds out there, <s>
we'll get to them," <s>
says Les Johns, De Beers's engineering manager. <s>
Here, <s>
wedged between shifting dunes and pounding waves at the world's most inhospitable diamond dig, <s>
lies the earth's most precious jewel box. <s>
Thanks to centuries of polishing by Mother Nature <s>
-- first in the gentle current of the Orange River <s>
that carried the stones from South Africa's interior, <s>
then in the cold surf of the ocean, and finally in the coarse sands of the desert -- <s>
98% of the diamonds uncovered are of gem quality. <s>
While other mines might yield more carats, <s>
a higher percentage of them go to industrial use. <s>
Since this treasure chest is too big <s>
to fit in a bank vault, <s>
it has been turned into one. <s>
Months after railway worker Zacharias Lewala first picked up a diamond from the sand in 1908, <s>
the German colonialists <s>
who controlled Namibia <s>
proclaimed a wide swath of the desert <s>
-- about 200 miles north from the Orange River and 60 miles inland from the Atlantic -- <s>
a restricted area, a designation normally reserved for military operations. <s>
When the Germans lost World War I, <s>
they lost Namibia to South Africa and the diamonds to Ernest Oppenheimer, patriarch of Anglo American Corp. and De Beers. <s>
Today, no one gets in or out of the restricted area <s>
without De Beers's stingy approval. <s>
The mining zone has thus remained one of the most desolate places in Africa. <s>
Ghost towns dot the Namib dunes, <s>
proving diamonds aren't forever. <s>
Oranjemund, the mine headquarters, is a lonely corporate oasis of 9,000 residents. <s>
Jackals roam the streets at night, <s>
and gemsbok, hardy antelope with long straight horns, wander in from the desert <s>
to drink from water sprinklers. <s>
On most days, the desert's heat and the cool of the ocean combine <s>
to create a mist like a damp rag. <s>
The wind, <s>
stinging with sand, <s>
never seems to stop. <s>
Still, miners from all parts of Namibia as well as professional staff from De Beers's head offices in South Africa and London keep coming. <s>
And Oranjemund boasts attractions besides diamonds. <s>
There are six video rental shops, three restaurants, one cinema and 34 sports and recreation clubs for everything from cricket to lawn bowling. <s>
The pride of Oranjemund is the 18-hole golf course <s>
-- with the largest sand trap in the world. <s>
Last year, <s>
when the rising Orange River threatened to swamp the course, <s>
the same engineers <s>
who are pushing back the Atlantic <s>
rushed to build a wall <s>
to hold back the flood. <s>
"Nothing is too good for our golf course," <s>
says Tony George, a mining engineer. <s>
Despite fears <s>
the mine may be partially nationalized by the new Namibian government <s>
following next month's elections <s>
freeing the country from South African control, <s>
De Beers engineers are working <s>
to extend the mine's productive life for another 25 years, from the current estimate of 10. <s>
Huge machines <s>
that look as though they came from the Star Wars desert-battle scene <s>
lumber among the dunes. <s>
Mechanized vacuum cleaners probe the sand like giant anteaters; <s>
a whirring ferris wheellike excavator, with buckets instead of seats, chews through layers of compacted sand; <s>
tracks and conveyor belts, <s>
shuttling sand to the screening plants, <s>
criss-cross the beach. <s>
Then there is the artifical sea wall, 600 yards long and 60 yards thick, <s>
jutting into the ocean. <s>
Made of sand, <s>
it receives around-the-clock maintainence against the battering waves. <s>
When the mining in front of the wall is complete, <s>
it is moved northward. <s>
A companion jetty <s>
that helps hold back the sea <s>
looks like a rusting junkyard. <s>
Engineers first used concrete blocks <s>
to bolster the barrier, <s>
but the ocean tossed them aside like driftwood. <s>
Then someone decided to try broken-down earthmoving equipment <s>
that, inexplicably, held against the waves. <s>
"The Caterpillar people aren't too happy <s>
when they see their equipment used like that," <s>
shrugs Mr. George. <s>
"They figure <s>
it's not a very good advert." <s>
Despite all these innovations, <s>
most of the diamonds are still found in the sand <s>
swept away by the men wielding shovels and brushes <s>
-- the ignominiously named "bedrock sweepers" <s>
who toil in the wake of the excavators. <s>
Laboring in blue and gray overalls, <s>
they are supposed to concentrate on cleaning out crevices, <s>
and not strain their eyes <s>
looking for diamonds. <s>
But <s>
should they spy one, <s>
the company will pay a bonus equal to one-third its value. <s>
For these workers at the bottom of the mine's pay scale, this is usually enough <s>
to overcome the temptation <s>
to steal <s>
-- a crime <s>
that could earn them up to 15 years in jail. <s>
Still, employees do occasionally try to smuggle out a gem or two. <s>
One man wrapped several diamonds in the knot of his tie. <s>
Another poked a hole in the heel of his shoe. <s>
A food caterer stashed stones in the false bottom of a milk pail. <s>
None made it past the body searches and X-rays of mine security. <s>
