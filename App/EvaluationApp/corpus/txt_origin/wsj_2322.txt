Traditional Industries Inc. said<s> 
it expects to report a net loss for the fourth quarter<s> 
that ended June 30<s> 
and is seeking new financing.<s> 
The seller of photographic products and services said<s> 
it is considering a number of financing alternatives,<s> 
including seeking increases in its credit lines.<s> 
Traditional declined to estimate the amount of the loss<s> 
and wouldn't say<s> 
if it expects to show a profit for the year.<s> 
In the year<s> 
ended June 30, 1988,<s> 
Traditional reported net income of $4.9 million, or $1.21 a share.<s> 
The company didn't break out its fourth-quarter results.<s> 
In the latest nine months net income was $4.7 million, or $1.31 a share, on revenue of $44.3 million.<s> 
Separately,<s> 
the company said<s> 
it would file a delayed fiscal-year report with the Securities and Exchange Commission "within approximately 45 days."<s> 
It said<s> 
the delay resulted from difficulties<s> 
in resolving its accounting of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.<s> 
Under an agreement<s> 
filed in federal court in August<s> 
to settle FTC objections to some Traditional sales practices,<s> 
Traditional said<s> 
it would establish a $250,000 trust fund<s> 
to provide refunds to certain customers.
