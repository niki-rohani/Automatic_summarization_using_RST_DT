Ralph Brown was 31,000 feet over Minnesota <s>
when both jets on his Falcon 20 flamed out. <s>
At 18,000 feet, <s>
he says, <s>
he and his co-pilot "were looking for an interstate or a cornfield" <s>
to land. <s>
At 13,000 feet, the engines restarted. <s>
But <s>
knowing <s>
that mechanics would probably ground him for repairs, <s>
Mr. Brown skipped his stop in nearby Chicago <s>
and set course to get his load <s>
-- a few hundred parcels -- <s>
to the Memphis package-sorting hub on time. <s>
Had he been a little less gung-ho, <s>
"I'd have gotten the thing on the ground <s>
and headed for the nearest bar," <s>
Mr. Brown says. <s>
But he flies for Federal Express Corp., perhaps the closest thing in corporate America to the Green Berets. <s>
Federal's employees work long hours <s>
and seem to thrive on the stress <s>
of racing the clock. <s>
Like Mr. Brown, they sometimes go to surprising lengths <s>
to meet that overarching corporate goal: <s>
delivering the goods on time. <s>
They are a tribute to Federal's management <s>
which, since the company's founding 16 years ago, has had its way with its work force <s>
-- an unusual feat in the contentious transportation industry. <s>
That may soon change. <s>
This month, Federal's 2,048 pilots, <s>
including some 961 <s>
acquired along with Tiger International Inc. in February, <s>
will decide whether to elect the powerful Air Line Pilots Association as their bargaining agent. <s>
The election, <s>
which would bring the first major union to Federal's U.S. operations, <s>
has pitted new hires against devoted veterans such as Mr. Brown. <s>
It has also rattled Federal's strongly anti-union management, <s>
which is already contending with melding far-flung operations and with falling profits. <s>
"A union, sooner or later, has to have an adversary, <s>
and it has to have a victory," <s>
Frederick W. Smith, Federal's chairman and chief executive, says with disdain. <s>
"In our formula, we don't have any losers except the competition." <s>
What managers really fear is that the pro-union movement could spread beyond the pilots. <s>
Under federal transportation law, a government mediator is attempting to reconcile the melding of Tiger's job classifications into Federal's. <s>
Depending on the outcome, <s>
the merged company may face union elections this fall among airplane mechanics, ramp workers, stock clerks and flight dispatchers. <s>
These groups constitute up to 10% of its work force. <s>
"Unions would have a profound effect on the whole culture of the company," <s>
says Bernard La Londe, a professor at Ohio State University at Columbus and a Federal consultant. <s>
That culture, <s>
carefully crafted by Mr. Smith, <s>
leaves little, if any, room for unions. <s>
Since founding the company, <s>
the charismatic Vietnam vet, <s>
who is still only 46 years old, <s>
has fostered an ethos of combat. <s>
Flights are "missions." <s>
Mr. Smith's managers have, at times, been called "Ho Chi Minh's Guerrillas." <s>
The Bravo Zulu award, the Navy accolade for a "job well done," is bestowed on Federal's workers <s>
who surpass the call of duty. <s>
Competitors are known as the "enemy." <s>
To reinforce employees' dedication, <s>
Mr. Smith pays well. <s>
He also lets workers vent steam through an elaborate grievance procedure <s>
and, as a perk, fly free in empty cockpit seats. <s>
He gives pep talks in periodic "family briefings" <s>
beamed internationally on "FXTV," the company's own television network. <s>
And, with many of his 70,000 workers, Mr. Smith's damn-the-torpedoes attitude has caught on. <s>
James Cleveland, a courier <s>
who earned a Bravo Zulu <s>
for figuring out how to get a major customer's 1,100-parcel-a-week load to its doorstep by 8 a.m., <s>
considers himself far more than a courier. <s>
"We don't just hand the customer the package. <s>
That's just the beginning," <s>
he says. <s>
"In essence, we run the show." <s>
David Sanders, a longtime pilot, bristles at the mere suggestion <s>
that a union might tamper with his flight schedule. <s>
"This is America," <s>
he says. <s>
"Nobody has the right <s>
to tell me <s>
how much I can work." <s>
Such attitudes have given Federal flexibility, <s>
not only to rapidly implement new technology <s>
but to keep its work force extraordinarily lean. <s>
The company deliberately understaffs, <s>
stretching employees' schedules to the limit. <s>
But <s>
though couriers work as many as 60 hours a week during the autumn rush, <s>
they leave early during slack times <s>
while still being assured of a minimum paycheck. <s>
Pilots, as well, routinely fly overtime <s>
to ensure <s>
that none are furloughed during seasonal lows. <s>
The operational freedom has also given Federal a leg up on archrival United Parcel Service Inc., the nation's largest employer of United Brotherhood of Teamsters members. <s>
UPS won't discuss its labor practices, <s>
but, <s>
according to Mr. Cleveland, a former UPS employee, and others, <s>
union work rules prohibit UPS drivers from doing more than carrying packages between customers and their vans. <s>
Because UPS drivers aren't permitted to load their own vehicles at the depot, <s>
say these couriers, <s>
packages often get buried in the load <s>
and are delivered late. <s>
Labor problems are the last thing <s>
Mr. Smith needs right now. <s>
Although the Tiger acquisition has brought Federal a long way toward becoming the global player <s>
it wants to be, <s>
it also has brought problems. <s>
It more than doubled Federal's long-term debt to $1.9 billion, <s>
thrust the company into unknown territory <s>
-- heavy cargo -- <s>
and suddenly expanded its landing rights to 21 countries from four. <s>
Federal, on its own, hadn't been doing very well overseas. <s>
It had hemorrhaged in its attempt to get into Asia, <s>
where treaty restrictions forced it to fly some planes half-empty on certain routes. <s>
On routes to South America, the company had no backup jets <s>
to ensure delivery <s>
when planes were grounded. <s>
In Europe, business suffered <s>
as Federal bought several local companies, <s>
only to have the managers quit. <s>
These and other problems squeezed Federal's profit margins last year to 8%, down from more than 13% annually in the first half of the decade. <s>
Earnings have plummeted, too, in each of the past three quarters. <s>
In the fiscal first period <s>
ended Aug. 31, <s>
profit fell 54% to $30.4 million, or 58 cents a share, <s>
mostly because of the Tiger merger, <s>
Federal says. <s>
Federal's stock price, however, has held up well, <s>
driven in part by the general run-up of airline stocks, <s>
analysts say. <s>
Since trading as low as $42.25 a share in May, <s>
Federal's shares have rallied as high as $57.87 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. <s>
They closed Friday at $53.25, down 50 cents on the day. <s>
There's a certain irony in the fact <s>
that Federal Express faces its first union problems <s>
as a result of its Tiger purchase. <s>
Tiger itself was founded by a band of gungho airmen <s>
who had airlifted supplies "over the Hump" from India to China during World War II. <s>
In the early 1970s, Mr. Smith modeled his fledgling company on Tiger's innovation of hub-and-spoke and containerized-cargo operations. <s>
But from early on, Tiger's workers unionized, <s>
while Federal's never have. <s>
Federal Express officials acknowledge mistakes in their drive overseas <s>
but say <s>
it will pay off eventually. <s>
Analysts expect Federal's earnings to improve again in its fiscal third quarter <s>
ending Feb. 28, <s>
when the company should begin benefiting from Tiger's extra flights, back-up planes and landing rights. <s>
Until then, they expect the cost <s>
of integrating the two carriers <s>
to continue crimping profits. <s>
For now, the union issue is the most nettlesome of Federal's Tiger problems, <s>
management believes. <s>
Although encouraging dialogue between managers and workers, <s>
Mr. Smith doesn't countenance what he considers insubordination. <s>
When a large group of pilots once signed petitions <s>
opposing work-rule and compensation changes, <s>
he called a meeting in a company hangar <s>
and dressed them down <s>
for challenging his authority. <s>
He then made most of the changes, <s>
pilots say. <s>
That sort of approach, however, hasn't worked since the addition of Tiger. <s>
Its 6,500 workers, <s>
who had battled Tiger's management for years over givebacks, <s>
were union members until the day of the merger, <s>
when most of their unions were automatically decertified. <s>
Soon after the merger, moreover, Federal's management asked Tiger's pilots to sign an agreement <s>
stating <s>
that they could be fired any time, <s>
without cause or notice. <s>
When the pilots refused, <s>
the company retracted it. <s>
Mr. Smith angered Federal's pilots, too. <s>
In his haste <s>
to seal the deal with Tiger Chairman Saul Steinberg last August, <s>
Mr. Smith ignored a promise <s>
that he had made to his own pilots three years ago: <s>
that any fliers <s>
acquired in future mergers <s>
would be "end-tailed" <s>
-- put at the bottom of the pilot seniority list <s>
that determines work schedules, pay and career options. <s>
The Tiger merger agreement stipulated <s>
that the lists be combined on the basis of tenure. <s>
Mr. Smith is trying hard to allay the anger. <s>
And even some pro-union pilots say <s>
his charisma and popularity among the many former military fliers could be tough to beat. <s>
"A lot of people are identifying a vote for representation as a vote against Fred Smith," <s>
says J.X. Gollich, a Tiger-turned-Federal pilot and union activist. <s>
Mr. Smith and other top Federal executives have met with Tiger workers in Los Angeles, Ohio, New York, Alaska, Asia and Europe. <s>
Recently, they have appeared every few weeks in talk-show type videos, <s>
countering pro-union arguments. <s>
In one video, Mr. Smith defended his agreement to merge the pilot-seniority lists. <s>
He said <s>
Mr. Steinberg had insisted <s>
that the merger talks move quickly. <s>
Regulators, as well, might have quashed the deal <s>
if Tiger's pilots hadn't been protected, <s>
he said. <s>
Furthermore, <s>
Mr. Smith added, <s>
"our contract with our pilots says <s>
that we will manage our fleet operations with their advice. <s>
It doesn't give any particular group the ability <s>
to veto change." <s>
Already, the fight has been costly. <s>
The seniority-list controversy, along with the job-classification dispute, has been turned over to the mediator. <s>
Meanwhile, the company is operating with two separate pilot groups and seniority lists, <s>
and that is costing Federal "a big number," <s>
says James Barksdale, executive vice president and chief operating officer. <s>
The issue has also cost Federal management a lot of good will among its old pilots. <s>
"They were willing to mistreat us <s>
because we hadn't shown any moxie, any resistance," <s>
says William Queenan, a DC-10 pilot and 14-year Federal veteran. <s>
Adds John Poag, a 727 captain and past chairman of the company-sponsored Flight Advisory Board: <s>
"They've made all these magnanimous gestures to the Flying Tiger pilots, and for us, nothing." <s>
Such animosity could prove pivotal in the union vote. <s>
A large majority of the 961 former Tiger fliers support the union, <s>
according to a union study. <s>
But <s>
though most of the 1,087 Federal pilots are believed opposed, <s>
it is unclear just how much their loyalty to Mr. Smith has been eroded. <s>
The fight has turned ugly <s>
and, among pilots at least, has shattered the esprit de corps <s>
that Mr. Smith worked so hard <s>
to build. <s>
Anti-union pilots have held ballot-burning parties. <s>
Some younger pilots say <s>
they have had to endure anti-union harangues by senior pilots <s>
while flying across the country. <s>
And for now, at least, the competition isn't the only enemy. <s>
Barney Barnhardt, a 727 captain and leader of the pro-union forces, said <s>
he has received two anonymous death threats <s>
and been challenged to a fight with tire irons by a colleague. <s>
"The pilots are either for us or extremely against us," <s>
he says with a sigh. <s>
