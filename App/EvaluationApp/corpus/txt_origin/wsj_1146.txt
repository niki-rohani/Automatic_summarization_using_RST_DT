The Polish rat will eat well this winter. <s>
Tons of delectably rotting potatoes, barley and wheat will fill damp barns across the land <s>
as thousands of farmers turn the state's buyers away. <s>
Many a piglet won't be born as a result, <s>
and many a ham will never hang in a butcher shop. <s>
But with inflation raging, <s>
grain in the barn will still be a safer bet for the private farmer than money in the bank. <s>
Once again, the indomitable peasant holds Poland's future in his hands. <s>
Until his labor can produce a profit in this dying and distorted system, <s>
even Solidarity's sympathetic new government won't win him over. <s>
In coming months, emergency food aid <s>
moving in from the West <s>
will be the one buffer between a meat-hungry public and a new political calamity. <s>
Factory workers on strike knocked Poland's Communist bosses off balance last year; <s>
this year, it was the farmers <s>
who brought them down. <s>
In June, farmers held onto meat, milk and grain, <s>
waiting for July's usual state-directed price rises. <s>
The Communists froze prices instead. <s>
The farmers ran a boycott, <s>
and meat disappeared from the shops. <s>
On Aug. 1, the state tore up its controls, <s>
and food prices leaped. <s>
Without buffer stocks, <s>
inflation exploded. <s>
That was when the tame old Peasants' Party, desperate to live through the crisis, broke ranks with the Communists <s>
and joined with Solidarity in the East Bloc's first liberated government. <s>
But by the time Solidarity took office in September, <s>
the damage was done. <s>
"Shortageflation," <s>
as economists have come to call it, <s>
had gone hyper. <s>
The cost of raising a pig kept bounding ahead of the return for selling one. <s>
The farmers stayed angry. <s>
They still are. <s>
At dawn on a cool day, hundreds travel to the private market in Radzymin, a town not far from Warsaw, <s>
hauling pigs, cattle and sacks of feed <s>
that the state's official buyers can't induce them to sell. <s>
Here, they are searching for a higher price. <s>
In a crush of trucks and horse carts on the trodden field, Andrzej Latowski wrestles a screeching, overweight hog into the trunk of a private butcher's Polish Fiat. <s>
"Of course it's better to sell private," <s>
he says, <s>
as the butcher trundles away. <s>
"Why should anybody want to sell to them?" <s>
The young farmer makes money on the few hogs <s>
he sells here. <s>
He won't for long, <s>
because his old state sources of rye and potatoes are drying up. <s>
"There's no feed," <s>
he says. <s>
"You can't buy anything nowadays. <s>
I don't know why." <s>
Edward Chojnowski does. <s>
His truck is parked across the field, in a row of grain sellers. <s>
Like the others, it is loaded with rye, wheat and oats in sacks <s>
labeled "Asbestos. <s>
Made in U.S.S.R." <s>
The farmer at the next truck shouts, <s>
"Wheat! <s>
It's nice! <s>
It won't be cheaper! <s>
We sell direct!" <s>
A heavy, kerchiefed woman runs a handful through her fingers, <s>
and counts him out a pile of zlotys. <s>
"Country people breed pigs," <s>
says Mr. Chojnowski, <s>
leaning against the back of his truck. <s>
"They can't buy feed from the state. <s>
There isn't enough. <s>
Some state middlemen come to buy from me. <s>
I sell <s>
-- a little. <s>
I am waiting. <s>
I have plenty more at home." <s>
On this morning, he doesn't sell much in Radzymin, either. <s>
At closing time, farmers cart out most of what they carted in. <s>
A private market like this just isn't big enough <s>
to absorb all that business. <s>
The hulk of Stalinism, <s>
it seems, <s>
will not quickly crumble away. <s>
State monopolies will keep on stifling trade, "free" prices or not, <s>
until something else replaces them. <s>
Polish agriculture will need a whole private network of procurement, processing and distribution <s>
-- plus a new manufacturing industry <s>
to supply it with tractors, pesticides, fertilizers and feed. <s>
The Communists spent 40 years <s>
working <s>
to ensure <s>
that no such capitalistic structures ever arose here. <s>
Building them now will require undergirding from the West, and removal of political deadwood, a job <s>
that Solidarity has barely started. <s>
But Polish agriculture does possess one great asset already: <s>
the private farmer. <s>
"We are dealing with real entrepreneurs," <s>
says Antoni Leopold, an economist <s>
who advises Rural Solidarity, the union's countryside offshoot. <s>
"There are a lot of them, <s>
and they have property." <s>
Polish peasants, <s>
spurning the collectivizers, <s>
were once a source of shame to orthodox Communists. <s>
Now, among Communist reformers, they are objects of envy. <s>
Food is the reformer's top priority, the key to popular support. <s>
As the Chinese have shown <s>
and the Soviets are learning, <s>
family farms thrive <s>
where collectives fail. <s>
Ownership, <s>
it seems, <s>
is the best fertilizer. <s>
The Poles have had it all along. <s>
Poland's 2.7 million small private farms cover 76% of its arable land. <s>
On it, a quarter of the country's 39 million people produce three-quarters of its grain, beef, eggs and milk, and nine-tenths of its fruit, vegetables and potatoes. <s>
Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Polish peasant is a pillar of the nation. <s>
Try as they might, <s>
the Communists could neither replace nor break him. <s>
And they did try. <s>
A few miles past Radzymin, a dirt road narrows to a track of sand <s>
and leads into Zalubice, a village of tumbledown farms. <s>
Czeslaw Pyszkiewicz owns 30 acres in 14 scattered scraps. <s>
He grows rye and potatoes for a few hens, five cows and 25 piglets. <s>
In patched pants and torn shoes, he stands in his barnyard <s>
eyeing the ground with a look both helpless and sardonic. <s>
"It's bad soil," <s>
he says. <s>
Until 1963, it was good soil. <s>
Then the state put in a reservoir <s>
to supply the area with drinking water. <s>
Farmers lay down before the bulldozers. <s>
Their protest was ignored. <s>
The dam caused the water level to drop in Zalubice. <s>
Mr Pyszkiewicz smiles and his brow furrows. <s>
He expected as much. <s>
In his lifetime, 47 years, the Communists brought electricity to his village <s>
and piped in drinking water from the reservoir. <s>
No phones. <s>
No gas. <s>
"We wanted them to build a road here," <s>
he says. <s>
"They started, <s>
and then abandoned it." <s>
A tractor, his only mechanized equipment, stands in front of the pigsty. <s>
"It's Russian. <s>
Good for nothing. <s>
Parts are a tragedy. <s>
Even if I had a lot of money, <s>
I couldn't buy what I need." <s>
The farmer can say the same for coal, cement, saw blades. <s>
In Poland, only 4% of all investment goes toward making things farmers want; <s>
in the West, it is closer to 20%. <s>
The few big state farms take first crack at what does get made. <s>
They use 60% more fertilizer per acre, twice the high-grade feed. <s>
Yet their best boast is that they produce 32% of Polish pork. <s>
"I've heard from friends <s>
that state farms are subsidized," <s>
Mr. Pyszkiewicz says <s>
as his wife, Wieslawa, sets some chairs out in the sun. <s>
"We have one near here. <s>
There is a lot of waste. <s>
A private farmer never wastes anything." <s>
The state quit shoving peasants onto its subsidized farms over 30 years ago. <s>
But it never did let up on the pressure. <s>
Until recently, a farmer with no heir had to will the state his land <s>
to collect his pension. <s>
The pension's size still depends on how much produce <s>
he sells the state. <s>
His allotment of materials also did, <s>
until the state couldn't hold up its end of that bargain. <s>
Yet the state alone sells seeds and machines. <s>
When supplies are short, <s>
it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain. <s>
A private farmer in Poland is free to buy and sell land, hire help, decide what to grow and how to grow it. <s>
He is free to invest in chickens, <s>
and to fail for lack of chicken wire. <s>
He has plenty of freedom <s>
-- but no choices. <s>
"I'm on my own land," <s>
Mr. Pyszkiewicz says. <s>
"I don't have to listen to what anybody tells me to do." <s>
"Sometimes," <s>
says his wife, <s>
"we're happy about that." <s>
By starving the peasant, <s>
the Communists have starved Poland. <s>
Villages like Zalubice exist in a desert of poor schools and few doctors. <s>
Farm income is 15% below the average. <s>
The young leave, especially girls <s>
who won't milk cows by hand. <s>
Some men stay, their best friend a bottle of vodka, <s>
but two million acres have gone fallow. <s>
Without machines, <s>
good farms can't get bigger. <s>
So the potato crop, once 47 million tons, is down to 35 million. <s>
Meat consumption is at 1979's level, <s>
pork production at 1973's, <s>
milk output at 1960's. <s>
If a food crisis undid the Communists, <s>
a food revolution will make Solidarity. <s>
The potential is displayed along every road into Warsaw: <s>
row upon row of greenhouses, <s>
stretching out behind modern mansions <s>
that trumpet their owners' wealth. <s>
Vegetables are abundant and full of flavor in Poland, <s>
the pickles and sauerkraut sublime, <s>
the state monopolies long broken. <s>
Grain, milk and meat come next. <s>
A private challenge to the monolithic tractor industry will take more time and money <s>
than Poland can spare, <s>
although a smokehouse or a local dairy can spring up fast. <s>
Poland makes no machinery for a plant on that scale. <s>
Solidarity wants it from the West. <s>
Maria Stolzman, one of its farm experts, lays it on the line: <s>
"The World Bank will be brought in <s>
to help us destroy the old system." <s>
Felix Siemienas is destroying it now. <s>
He packs pork. <s>
A law went on the books in January <s>
that let him smoke bacon <s>
without breeding pigs. <s>
He cashed in. <s>
Poland is short on enterprises, not enterprise. <s>
"I pay a lot to the farmer and five times the state salary to my employees," <s>
he says. <s>
He is in Warsaw <s>
to open a shop. <s>
"I hire transportation, <s>
and my customers have fresh cold cuts every day. <s>
I don't subsidize anyone. <s>
Everyone around me lives well. <s>
Yes, my prices are high. <s>
If nobody buys, <s>
I bring my prices down. <s>
That's the rule. <s>
That's the market." <s>
Mr. Siemienas is making a fortune <s>
-- $10,000 a month, <s>
he says. <s>
He has bought some trendy Western clothes, and a green Mercedes with an American flag in the window. <s>
But the meat-processing machines <s>
he picked up <s>
are 50 years old. <s>
"I don't want expensive machines. <s>
If the situation changes, <s>
I'll get stuck with them." <s>
That's politics. <s>
By taking power in a deal with the Peasant Party's onetime Communist stooges, <s>
Solidarity has spooked the rural entrepreneur. <s>
Rural Solidarity objected, to no avail, <s>
when Solidarity leader Lech Walesa accepted the Peasants' support. <s>
It objected again in September <s>
when Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki reluctantly named a Peasant Party man as his agriculture minister. <s>
Both the Peasants and Rural Solidarity are forming new political parties for farmers. <s>
The Peasants can make a credible case, against Solidarity, <s>
that hell-bent reform will drive millions from the land. <s>
Next Spring, the two will battle in local elections. <s>
But until then, and probably long afterward, the Communists' apparat of obstruction <s>
-- from the head of the dairy co-op to the village bank manager -- <s>
will stay planted in the Polish countryside. <s>
"We know how to get from capitalism to socialism," <s>
Sergiusz Niciporuk is saying one afternoon. <s>
"We don't know how to get from socialism to capitalism." <s>
He farms 12 acres in Grabowiec, two miles from the Soviet border in one of Poland's poorest places. <s>
Now he is mounting the steps of a stucco building in a nearby village, on a visit to the Communist administrator, the "naczelnik." <s>
"Many people in Poland hope <s>
this government will break down," <s>
says Mr. Niciporuk, <s>
who belongs to the local council and to Rural Solidarity. <s>
"That's what the naczelnik counts on. <s>
He is our most dangerous enemy. <s>
Every time he sees me, <s>
he gets very nervous." <s>
The farmer barges into the naczelnik's office. <s>
A thin man in a gray suit looks up from a newspaper. <s>
Mr. Niciporuk sits. <s>
Anatol Pawlowski's leg begins jiggling beneath his desk. <s>
"Solidarity doesn't care for the good of this region," <s>
he says after a few pleasantries. <s>
"They want to turn everything upside down in a week. <s>
Mr. Niciporuk here wants 60 acres <s>
used at the moment by a state farm. <s>
He can't guarantee <s>
that he can use it any better." <s>
"I am ready at any moment to compete with a state farm." <s>
The naczelnik averts his eyes. <s>
"What have you got? <s>
Not even a tractor. <s>
And you want to make wicker baskets, too." <s>
"I can do five things at once <s>
-- to be a businessman." <s>
"Big business," <s>
Mr. Pawlowski snorts in English. <s>
The farmer stands to go. <s>
The naczelnik stands, too. <s>
"I care very much for this post," <s>
he says. <s>
"Eight years I've had it. <s>
A cultural center has been built, shops. <s>
Suddenly, I am not a comfortable man for Solidarity. <s>
I have accomplished too much. <s>
They want to do more. <s>
I wish them all the best!" <s>
The farmer leaves. <s>
And the naczelnik shuts his door. <s>
