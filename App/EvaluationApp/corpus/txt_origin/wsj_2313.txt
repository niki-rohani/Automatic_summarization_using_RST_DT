Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. said <s>
it formed a $53.4 million limited partnership subsidiary <s>
to buy land in California suitable for residential development. <s>
The partnership, Kaufman & Broad Land Development Venture Limited Partnership, is a 50-50 joint venture with a trust <s>
created by institutional clients of Heitman Advisory Corp., a unit of Heitman Financial Corp., a real estate advisory, management and development company with offices in Chicago and Beverly Hills, Calif. <s>
Kaufman & Broad, a home building company, declined to identify the institutional investors. <s>
The land <s>
to be purchased by the joint venture <s>
hasn't yet received zoning and other approvals <s>
required for development, <s>
and part of Kaufman & Broad's job will be to obtain such approvals. <s>
The partnership runs the risk <s>
that it may not get the approvals for development, <s>
but in return, it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices, <s>
which can result in sizable savings, <s>
said Bruce Karatz, president and chief executive officer of Kaufman & Broad. <s>
"There are really very few companies <s>
that have adequate capital <s>
to buy properties in a raw state for cash. <s>
Typically, developers option property, <s>
and then <s>
once they get the administrative approvals, <s>
they buy it," <s>
said Mr. Karatz, <s>
adding <s>
that he believes <s>
the joint venture is the first of its kind. <s>
"We usually operate in that conservative manner." <s>
By setting up the joint venture, <s>
Kaufman & Broad can take the more aggressive approach <s>
of buying raw land, <s>
while avoiding the negative impacts to its own balance sheet, <s>
Mr. Karatz said. <s>
The company is putting up only 10% of the capital, <s>
although it is responsible for providing management, planning and processing services to the joint venture. <s>
"This is one of the best ways <s>
to assure a pipeline of land <s>
to fuel our growth at a minimum risk to our company," <s>
Mr. Karatz said. <s>
