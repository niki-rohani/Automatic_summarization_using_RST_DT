Probably the most clear-cut Soviet violation, for example, is the Krasnoyarsk radar. <s>
-- "Arms Control Reality," Nov. 20, 1984, the first of some 20 Journal editorials <s>
saying <s>
that Krasnoyarsk violated the ABM treaty. <s>
-- "Whether the installation is for early warning or space track, <s>
it clearly is not deployed," <s>
the lawmakers said. <s>
"Thus we judge it to be not a violation of the ABM treaty at this time." <s>
The delegation included a reporter from the New York Times, aides to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and Rep. Les AuCoin, and Natural Resources Defense Council staff members. <s>
-- The Washington Post, Sept. 9, 1987. <s>
-- The U.S.S.R. has taken unprecedented unilateral measures of openness, <s>
by giving American representatives a possibility <s>
to inspect the building site of the Krasnoyarsk radar as well as radar vans in the areas of Gomel and Moscow, <s>
so as to see for themselves <s>
that there are no violations of the ABM treaty of 1972 on the part of the Soviet Union. <s>
-- Letter from Eduard Shevardnadze to U.N. Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar, <s>
reported in Tass, June 10, 1988. <s>
-- The construction of this station equal in size to the Egyptian pyramids constituted, <s>
I say it directly, <s>
a clear violation of ABM. <s>
-- Eduard Shevardnadze, Oct. 23, 1989. <s>
We're happy, <s>
we guess, <s>
to receive confirmation of the Krasnoyarsk violation from the Soviets, <s>
five years after we started writing about it. <s>
Perhaps even the American apologists will now accede. <s>
Without question, <s>
something intriguing is going on in the policy chambers of the Politburo. <s>
As it bids for new agreements, new loans and indeed admission to the civilized world, <s>
the Soviet government has recognized <s>
it has a credibility problem. <s>
So after 70 years, it is confessing the obvious, <s>
hoping to be believed about other things. <s>
It's not enough. <s>
If the Soviets want to be believed, <s>
they need to start telling the truth about more than the totally obvious. <s>
Our own test of "glasnost's" authenticity would be a Soviet decision <s>
to open itself to a complete international examination of one of the most troubling mysteries in U.S.-Soviet relations <s>
-- the reported 1979 anthrax outbreak at a Soviet military facility in Sverdlovsk. <s>
The U.S. government has never waivered in its assessment of this incident as an accident at a biological weapons facility there, and hence a violation of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention. <s>
The Pentagon's recently issued "Soviet Military Power," <s>
though in general adopting a softer line, <s>
repeated the Sverdlovsk assessment. <s>
It also was detailed in Congressional testimony this past February: <s>
An explosion at the Microbiology and Virology Institute in Sverdlovsk released anthrax germs <s>
that caused a significant number of deaths. <s>
Since Mr. Shevardnadze did not address this topic before the Supreme Soviet, <s>
the Soviet Union's official position remains <s>
that the anthrax deaths were caused by tainted meat. <s>
We doubt this claim <s>
just as we doubted Mr. Shevardnadze's assurance last year <s>
that Krasnoyarsk didn't violate the ABM treaty. <s>
And just as we did not believe the tendentious claims of the Congressmen and arms-control advocates <s>
who visited Krasnoyarsk, <s>
we are in no way persuaded by the assent to the tainted-meat theory by a U.S. team of scientists <s>
who met with Soviet counterparts in Washington last year. <s>
The Soviets' explanation is that the anthrax came from one lot of animal feed <s>
made from the bones of cattle <s>
that grazed on soil <s>
that was naturally infected with anthrax spores. <s>
Harvard's Matthew Meselson <s>
-- who <s>
we read <s>
has sold something <s>
called the "scientific community" on the notion <s>
that "yellow rain" attacks on the Laotian Hmong were in fact the result of fecal showers by giant bees -- <s>
found the Soviet anthrax scenario "completely plausible." <s>
We don't believe it. <s>
And we certainly do not believe <s>
that Mr. Gorbachev or any of his emissaries yet deserve to have the West take their word for it. <s>
Sverdlovsk is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms-control process itself. <s>
The U.S. government's Sverdlovsk complaint, as with Krasnoyarsk, is no mere political posturing. <s>
Biological weapons violations have figured little in political debate, <s>
and indeed have not been pressed vigorously enough by the U.S. government. <s>
But the stated U.S. position is detailed and specific, <s>
and the prospect of biological warfare is profoundly chilling. <s>
The Soviets should be willing to set in motion a process <s>
that would allow them to acknowledge <s>
that Sverdlovsk violated the 1972 agreement <s>
or, alternatively, that would give U.S. specialists reasonable confidence <s>
that this was a wholly civilian accident. <s>
Until that happens, <s>
glasnost cannot begin to deserve the kind of credibility <s>
Mr. Shevardnadze was bidding for with his confessions on Monday. <s>
