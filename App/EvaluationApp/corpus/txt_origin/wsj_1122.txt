DISASTER STATES aren't jumping to raise taxes for relief and recovery. <s>
Not yet, anyway. <s>
Just after Hurricane Hugo battered South Carolina, <s>
some officials talked of perhaps adding a penny to the state gasoline tax or raising property taxes. <s>
Gov. Campbell responded, <s>
"They're mentioning rope <s>
when there's been a hanging in the family." <s>
A spokesman says <s>
the governor believes <s>
he can avoid increases <s>
by relying on federal aid <s>
and shifting funds in state programs. <s>
Still, Hugo's impact may revive unsuccessful proposals <s>
to give local governments authority <s>
to levy sales taxes. <s>
A spokesman for North Carolina Gov. Martin says <s>
Hugo hasn't prompted proposals for state or local increases. <s>
California, <s>
where earthquake damage may top $5 billion, <s>
plans a special legislative session. <s>
Property-tax relief is likely. <s>
Legislators are talking about temporary rises in sales or gasoline taxes, <s>
although Gov. Deukmejian says <s>
they should be a last resort. <s>
Needs aren't clear, <s>
and the state constitution makes increasing taxes and spending very difficult. <s>
But some legislators think <s>
the time may be ripe <s>
to revise the constitution. <s>
THE IRS WILL PAY <s>
if its error burdens you with bank charges. <s>
Policy statement P-5-39 sets out terms. <s>
As a result of an erroneous IRS levy on a bank account, <s>
a taxpayer may incur administrative and overdraft charges. <s>
If the IRS admits its error <s>
and the charges have been paid, <s>
it will reimburse a taxpayer <s>
who hasn't refused to give timely answers to IRS inquiries <s>
or hasn't contributed to continuing or compounding the error. <s>
The IRS recently amended the policy <s>
to cover stop-payment charges for checks <s>
lost by the IRS. <s>
If the IRS asks for and gets a replacement for a check <s>
that it concedes <s>
it lost in processing, <s>
it will reimburse the taxpayer for the stop-payment charge on the original. <s>
Reimbursement claims must be filed with the IRS district or service-center director <s>
within a year after the expense accrues. <s>
If the IRS seeks late-payment interest <s>
because of the lost check, <s>
you should request interest abatement, <s>
publisher Prentice Hall notes. <s>
JUST FIVE ACRES MORE are all <s>
we need <s>
to feel really at home, <s>
they say. <s>
A couple <s>
we'll call the Blandings <s>
spent nearly $800,000 on a 15-acre plot and main home <s>
and have an old $175,000 mortgage exempt from the new limit on mortgage-interest deductions. <s>
They plan to expand the home site <s>
by buying five adjoining acres for $200,000, <s>
borrowed against a first mortgage on the five acres <s>
and also collateralized by the 15 acres. <s>
Their debt will be well under the $1 million limit <s>
-- on borrowing <s>
to acquire, build, or improve a home -- <s>
that qualifies for mortgage-interest deductions. <s>
As you can guess, <s>
the Blandings want to deduct home-mortgage interest on the $200,000 loan. <s>
But, <s>
IRS private ruling 8940061 notes, <s>
no rule or court case bears directly on the issue <s>
of adding land to a principal residence. <s>
So the IRS has drawn a rationale from the sale of a home site <s>
split in two <s>
and sold in different years to the same buyer; <s>
a court let the seller in that old case treat this as the sale of one residence. <s>
Thus, <s>
the IRS says, <s>
the Blandings' $200,000 loan is home-acquisition debt, <s>
and interest on it is fully deductible. <s>
EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS <s>
facing imminent filing and payment deadlines <s>
will get extensions and penalty waivers like those <s>
provided for Hugo's victims; <s>
IRS Notice 89108 has details. <s>
Notice 89-107 offers added relief for hurricane-hit concerns <s>
that must file pension and benefit-plan returns. <s>
REPORTS OF PAYMENTS to independent contractors for services must be filed by businesses, <s>
but don't bet that contractors' unreported income will be detected that way. <s>
The General Accounting Office estimates <s>
that 50% of IRS audits don't spot companies <s>
that fail to file the reports. <s>
UH HUH: <s>
A claim by Peter Testa of New York <s>
that a stranger paid him $500 <s>
to go into a bank <s>
and change $44,400 in small bills into large bills <s>
"is unconvincing," <s>
the Tax Court found. <s>
It held <s>
that Testa is taxable on $44,400 of unreported income. <s>
WHY BE A MIDDLEMAN for charitable gifts? <s>
a retiree asks. <s>
A retired electrical engineer <s>
we'll call Ben <s>
works part-time as a consultant, <s>
but he doesn't want to earn so much <s>
that Social Security reduces his benefits. <s>
So he has arranged for a university foundation to set up a scholarship fund for undergraduate engineering students. <s>
He plans to tell clients to pay certain fees directly to the foundation instead of to him; <s>
he would omit those fees from income <s>
reported on his return. <s>
So he asked the IRS <s>
if the plan would work. <s>
Well, <s>
notes IRS private ruling 8934014, <s>
"a fundamental principle" is that income must be taxed to whoever earns it. <s>
The rule goes back at least as far as a 1930 Supreme Court decision, <s>
Robert Willens of Shearson Lehman Hutton says. <s>
If you assign your income to another, <s>
you still have controlled its disposition <s>
and enjoyed the fruits of your labor, even if indirectly. <s>
Ben earns any fees <s>
sent directly to charity <s>
and is taxable on them, <s>
the IRS says; <s>
of course, he also may take a charitable deduction for them. <s>
