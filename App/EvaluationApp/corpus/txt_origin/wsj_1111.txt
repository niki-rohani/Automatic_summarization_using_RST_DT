Norfolk Southern Corp. directors authorized the railroad company to buy back as many as 45 million of its shares, <s>
which would have a current value of more than $1.7 billion. <s>
The buy-back, <s>
coupled with a nearly completed earlier purchase of 20 million shares, <s>
would reduce shares outstanding by more than 26%. <s>
The Norfolk, Va., company has 172.2 million shares outstanding. <s>
In a statement, Arnold B. McKinnon, chairman and chief executive officer, noted <s>
that the new repurchase program "should serve to enhance shareholder value." <s>
A spokeswoman said <s>
the company will finance the buy-back with cash on hand, borrowing and "cash <s>
Norfolk expects to generate." <s>
Analysts said <s>
they expected the action, <s>
and investors applauded the move. <s>
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Norfolk Southern shares closed at $37.875, up $1.125. <s>
Still, analysts don't expect the buy-back to significantly affect per-share earnings in the short term. <s>
"The impact won't be that great," <s>
said Graeme Lidgerwood of First Boston Corp. <s>
That is in part because of the effect <s>
of having to average the number of shares outstanding, <s>
she said. <s>
In addition, <s>
Mrs. Lidgerwood said, <s>
Norfolk is likely to draw down its cash initially <s>
to finance the purchases <s>
and thus forfeit some interest income. <s>
Longer term, however, the buy-back is expected to increase earnings, especially after 1990, <s>
Mrs. Lidgerwood said. <s>
Moreover, the extensive program in effect establishes a floor for the stock price, <s>
said Joel Price, analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. <s>
The buy-back "is really a comfort to those <s>
who want to buy the stock <s>
that there is a {price} floor," <s>
he said. <s>
"At a certain price, <s>
if the management thinks <s>
{the stock} is cheap, <s>
they can go in <s>
and buy it." <s>
Under the program, Norfolk plans to acquire shares in the open market. <s>
Under the earlier plan, Norfolk was authorized in 1987 to buy up to 20 million shares. <s>
It has purchased about 19 million of them. <s>
