Few people are aware<s>
that the federal government lends almost as much money<s>
as it borrows.<s>
From 1980 to 1988,<s>
while federal budget deficits totaled $1.41 trillion,<s>
the government issued $394 billion of new direct loans and an additional $756 billion of new primary loan guarantees.<s>
These figures omit secondary guarantees, deposit insurance, and the activities of Government-Sponsored Enterprises<s>
(a huge concern in its own right,<s>
as detailed on this page May 3).<s>
Federal credit programs date back to the New Deal,<s>
and were meant to break even financially.<s>
Since the 1950s, federal lending has experienced extraordinary growth in credit volume, subsidy rates, and policy applications,<s>
spurred on by the growth of government in general and budget gimmicks and deceptive management in particular.<s>
As we will see,<s>
many of these obligations don't show up as part of the federal deficit.<s>
But recent events indicate<s>
that federal credit is out of control.<s>
Student loan defaults remain high at about 12%,<s>
and the program has been rocked by allegations of fraud and mismanagement.<s>
Farmers Home Administration<s>
(FmHA)<s>
loans have turned into de facto giveaway programs;<s>
losses over the next three years are expected to exceed $20 billion.<s>
Defaults on Veterans Affairs loan guarantees have quadrupled in the past eight years.<s>
Last month, the General Accounting Office reported<s>
that defaults in Federal Housing Administration guarantees were five times as high<s>
as previously estimated,<s>
and that FHA's equity fell to minus $2.9 billion.<s>
GAO's findings are particularly troubling<s>
because the FHA has about $300 billion in obligations outstanding<s>
and had previously been considered one of the most financially secure credit programs.<s>
Scores of other credit programs,<s>
subsidizing agriculture, small business, exporters, defense, energy, transportation and others,<s>
are less visible but in no better shape.<s>
If the programs continue their present path,<s>
the potential government losses are staggering:<s>
The federal government holds $222 billion in direct loans outstanding<s>
and backs an additional $550 billion in primary guarantees.<s>
(Secondary guarantees of pools of FHA- and VA-backed loans by the agency<s>
known as Ginnie Mae<s>
currently exceed $330 billion.)<s>
Although external events have contributed to the morass,<s>
the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs.<s>
To reduce the risks<s>
while still retaining the legitimate benefits<s>
these programs can provide,<s>
credit policy must:<s>
1. Use credit<s>
to improve the operation of capital markets,<s>
not to provide subsidies.<s>
There is a fundamental conflict<s>
between providing a subsidy<s>
and maintaining the integrity of a credit program.<s>
If the program is meant to provide a subsidy,<s>
collecting the debt defeats the original goal.<s>
Thus, subsidized loans tend to turn into giveaway programs, with increasing subsidy and default rates over time.<s>
To avoid this problem,<s>
government should issue credit<s>
only if it intends to use every legal method<s>
to collect.<s>
In contrast, credit programs can be appropriate tools<s>
to improve the operation of capital markets.<s>
For example, legal restrictions on interstate banking once inhibited the supply of credit to the agricultural sector.<s>
Farm lending was enacted<s>
to correct this problem<s>
by providing a reliable flow of lendable funds.<s>
However, this in no way justifies the huge government subsidies and losses on such loans.<s>
Credit policy should separate these two competing objectives<s>
and eliminate aspects<s>
that provide the subsidy.<s>
For example, student loans currently attempt to subsidize college attendance and mitigate problems<s>
created by the fact<s>
that students' future earnings are not accepted as collateral.<s>
The program provides highly subsidized loans to any student<s>
whose family earns less than a particular amount.<s>
High default rates, a low interest rate, and government coverage of all interest costs<s>
while the student is in school<s>
make program costs extremely high.<s>
Families<s>
that do not need the loan<s>
can make money<s>
simply by putting the loan in the bank<s>
and paying it back<s>
when the student graduates.<s>
In contrast, a student loan program<s>
that was meant solely to correct capital-market imperfections<s>
would allow loans for any student,<s>
regardless of family income,<s>
at market or near-market rates.<s>
While the student was in school,<s>
interest costs would either be paid by the student<s>
or added to the loan balance.<s>
This program,<s>
combined with cash grants to needy students,<s>
would reduce program costs<s>
and much more effectively target the intended beneficiaries.<s>
2. Provide better incentives.<s>
Given the structure of most credit programs,<s>
it is surprising that default rates are not even higher.<s>
Guarantee rates are typically 100%,<s>
giving lenders little reason<s>
to screen customers carefully.<s>
Reducing those rates moderately<s>
(say, to 75%)<s>
would still provide substantial assistance to borrowers.<s>
But it would also encourage lenders to choose more creditworthy customers,<s>
and go a long way toward reducing defaults.<s>
For example, the Small Business Administration has had reasonable success<s>
in reducing both guarantee rates and default rates in its Preferred Lenders' Program.<s>
Borrowers' incentives are equally skewed.<s>
Since the government has a dismal record<s>
of collecting bad debts,<s>
the costs to the borrower of defaulting are usually low.<s>
In addition, it is often possible to obtain a new government loan<s>
even if existing debts are not paid off.<s>
Simple policy prescriptions in this case would be to improve debt collection<s>
(taking the gloves off contracted collection agencies)<s>
and to deny new credit to defaulters.<s>
These provisions would be difficult to enforce for a program<s>
intended to provide a subsidy,<s>
but would be reasonable and effective devices for programs<s>
that attempt to offset market imperfections.<s>
3. Record the true costs of credit programs in the federal budget.<s>
Since the budget measures cash flow,<s>
a new $1 direct loan is treated as a $1 expenditure,<s>
even though at least part of the loan will be paid back.<s>
Loan guarantees don't appear at all<s>
until the borrower defaults,<s>
so new guarantees do not raise the deficit,<s>
even though they create future liabilities for the government.<s>
By converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee,<s>
the government can ensure the same flow of resources<s>
and reduce the current deficit.<s>
Predictably, guarantees outstanding have risen by $130 billion since 1985,<s>
while direct loans outstanding have fallen by $30 billion.<s>
The true budgetary cost of a credit subsidy is the discounted value of the net costs to government.<s>
This figure could be estimated<s>
using techniques<s>
employed by private lenders<s>
to forecast losses,<s>
or determined<s>
by selling loans to private owners<s>
(without federal guarantees).<s>
Neither technique is perfect,<s>
but both are better than the current system,<s>
which misstates the costs of new credit programs by amounts<s>
that vary substantially<s>
and average about $20 billion annually,<s>
according to the Congressional Budget Office.<s>
A budget<s>
that reflected the real costs of lending<s>
would eliminate incentives<s>
to convert spending or lending programs to guarantees<s>
and would let taxpayers know<s>
what Congress is committing them to.<s>
4. Impose standard accounting and administrative practices.<s>
Creative accounting is a hallmark of federal credit.<s>
Many agencies roll over their debt,<s>
paying off delinquent loans<s>
by issuing new loans,<s>
or converting defaulted loan guarantees into direct loans.<s>
In any case, they avoid having to write off the loans.<s>
Some agencies simply keep bad loans on the books;<s>
as late as 1987, the Export-Import Bank held in its portfolio at face value loans<s>
made to Cuba in the 1950s.<s>
More seriously, FmHA has carried several billion dollars of defaulted loans at face value.<s>
Until GAO's recent audit, FHA books had not been subject to a complete external audit in 15 years.<s>
The administration of federal credit should closely parallel private lending practices,<s>
including the development of a loan loss reserve and regular outside audits.<s>
Establishing these practices would permit earlier identification of emerging financial crises,<s>
provide better information for loan sales and budgeting decisions,<s>
and reduce fraud.<s>
Government lending was not intended to be a way<s>
to obfuscate spending figures,<s>
hide fraudulent activity,<s>
or provide large subsidies.<s>
The reforms<s>
described above<s>
would provide a more limited, but clearer, safer and ultimately more useful role for government as a lender.<s>
Without such reforms,<s>
credit programs will continue to be a large-scale, high-risk proposition for taxpayers.<s>
