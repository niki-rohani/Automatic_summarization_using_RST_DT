Xerox Corp. 's third-quarter net income grew 6.2% on 7.3% higher revenue,<s>
earning mixed reviews from Wall Street analysts.<s>
Quarter net for the business-machines and financial-services company rose to $155 million, or $1.41 a share, from $146 million, or $1.37 a share, in the year-earlier period.<s>
Revenue rose to $4.45 billion from $4.15 billion.<s>
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Xerox closed at $62.75 a share, up $1.<s>
Sales growth and profit in business products and systems<s>
-- Xerox's main business --<s>
were "disappointing,"<s>
said B. Alex Henderson,<s>
who follows the company for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.<s>
Sales of Xerox copiers and other office products grew 1.6%;<s>
"we expected growth of 6% to 7%,"<s>
Mr. Henderson said.<s>
Operating-profit margins slipped almost 18%, to 4.3% of sales,<s>
the analyst noted.<s>
Still,<s>
with competitors such as Eastman Kodak Co. faltering in copier sales,<s>
Xerox's sales increases "were encouraging,"<s>
says Eugene Glazer of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.<s>
"They are holding their own in a weak market,<s>
and the restructuring is working,"<s>
he says.<s>
David T. Kearns, Xerox chairman and chief executive officer, cited the restructuring and "strong" cost controls for the 13% growth in profit from business products and systems operations.<s>
Mr. Glazer expects Xerox to experience tough sledding, though, in financial services<s>
because of rate pressures and uncertainty<s>
surrounding tax treatment of capital gains.<s>
In the quarter, the Crum & Forster insurance unit reported $200 million before tax of capital gains from property and casualty operations.<s>
The subsidiary also increased reserves by $140 million, however,<s>
and set aside an additional $25 million for claims<s>
connected with Hurricane Hugo.<s>
For the nine months, Xerox earned $492 million, or $4.55 a share, up 5.8% from $465 million, or $4.32 a share.<s>
Revenue rose 7.6% to $12.97 billion from $12.05 billion.<s>
