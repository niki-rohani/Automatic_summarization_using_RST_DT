Soichiro Honda's picture now hangs with Henry Ford's in the U.S. Automotive Hall of Fame,<s>
and the game-show "Jeopardy" is soon to be Sony-owned.<s>
But no matter how much Japan gets under our skin,<s>
we'll still have mom and apple pie.<s>
On second thought, make that just mom.<s>
A Japanese apple<s>
called the Fuji<s>
is cropping up in orchards the way<s>
Hondas did on U.S. roads.<s>
By 1995 it will be planted more often than any other apple tree,<s>
according to a recent survey of six apple-industry sages by Washington State University horticulturist Robert Norton.<s>
Some fruit visionaries say<s>
the Fuji could someday tumble the Red Delicious from the top of America's apple heap.<s>
It certainly won't get there on looks.<s>
Compared to the Red Delicious, the exemplar of apple pulchritude,<s>
the Fuji is decidedly more dowdy<s>
-- generally smaller, less-perfectly shaped, greenish, with tinges of red.<s>
To hear most U.S. growers tell it,<s>
we'd still be in Paradise<s>
if the serpent had proffered one to Eve.<s>
But how sweet it is.<s>
It has more sugar "than any apple<s>
we've ever tested,"<s>
says Duane Greene, a University of Massachusetts pomologist, or apple scholar.<s>
It has a long shelf life<s>
and "doesn't fool the public,"<s>
says Grady Auvil, an Orondo, Wash., grower<s>
who is planting Fujis<s>
and spreading the good word about them.<s>
"It doesn't look nice on the outside<s>
while getting mealy inside."<s>
Mr. Auvil, razor sharp at 83, has picked and packed a zillion pecks of apples over the past 65 years.<s>
He is known as the father of the U.S.-grown Granny Smith, a radically different apple<s>
that<s>
the conventional wisdom once said<s>
would never catch on.<s>
It did,<s>
shaking the apple establishment to its roots.<s>
Now, even more radical changes seem afoot<s>
as the grand old maverick of American apples plays the role of Hiroshi Appleseed.<s>
"The Fuji is going to be No. 1<s>
to replace the Red Delicious,"<s>
he says.<s>
The Delicious hegemony won't end anytime soon.<s>
New apple trees grow slowly,<s>
and the Red Delicious is almost as entrenched as mom.<s>
Its roots are patriotic<s>
-- with the first trees appearing in 1872 in an orchard near Peru, Iowa,<s>
to be exact.<s>
For more than 50 years, it has been the apple of our eye.<s>
A good Delicious can indeed be delicious.<s>
More than twice as many Red Delicious apples are grown as the Golden variety, America's No. 2 apple.<s>
But the apple industry is ripe for change.<s>
"Red Delicious has been overplanted,<s>
and its prices have dropped below the cost of production,"<s>
says Washington State's Mr. Norton.<s>
The scare over Alar, a growth regulator<s>
that makes apples redder and crunchier<s>
but may be carcinogenic,<s>
made consumers shy away from the Delicious,<s>
though they were less affected than the McIntosh.<s>
The glut and consequent lower prices,<s>
combined with cancer fears,<s>
was a very serious blow to growers.<s>
"A lot of growers won't be around in a few years,"<s>
says Mr. Norton,<s>
although they have stopped using Alar.<s>
One may be William Broderick, a Sterling, Mass., grower.<s>
"This is beautiful stuff,"<s>
he says,<s>
looking ruefully at big boxes of just-picked Red Delicious next to his barn.<s>
"But I'm going to lose $50,000 to $60,000 on it.<s>
I'm going to have to get another job this year<s>
just to eat."<s>
Besides rotten prices, he has been hit recently by hail, a bark-nibbling horde of mice, fungi and bugs.<s>
Some 500 insects and 150 diseases wiggle, chew and romp through growers' nightmares,<s>
including maggots, mites, mildew, thrips, black rot and the flat-headed borer.<s>
Even if a grower beats them back,<s>
his $2,000 rented bees might buzz off to the neighbors' orchards<s>
instead of pollinating his,<s>
Mr. Broderick says.<s>
Though growers can't always keep the worm from the apple,<s>
they can protect themselves against the price vagaries of any one variety<s>
by diversifying<s>
-- into the recently imported Gala, a sweet New Zealand native; the Esopus Spitzenburg, reportedly Thomas Jefferson's favorite apple; disease-resistant kinds like the Liberty.<s>
"I've ripped out a lot of Delicious"<s>
and grafted the trees with many different shoots,<s>
says Steve Wood, a West Lebanon, N.H., grower,<s>
tramping through his 100-acre Poverty Lane Orchard on a crisp autumn day recently.<s>
"I've got 70 kinds of apples.<s>
Here's a Waltana,"<s>
he exclaims,<s>
picking one off a tree.<s>
He bites it,<s>
scowls<s>
and throws it down.<s>
"It's a real dog."<s>
Supermarkets are getting into the variety act, too.<s>
They still buy apples mainly for big, red good looks<s>
-- that's why so many taste like woodchucks' punching bags.<s>
But freshness counts<s>
more than it once did,<s>
and stores are expanding shelf space for unconventional, but tastier, and often pricier, apples.<s>
"Rather than sell 39-cents-a-pound Delicious,<s>
maybe we can sell 79-cents-a-pound Fujis,"<s>
says Chuck Tryon, perishables director for Super Valu Inc., a Minneapolis supermarket chain and food distributor.<s>
The Fuji is a product of meticulous Japanese pomological engineering,<s>
which fostered it 50 years ago at a government research orchard.<s>
Japanese researchers have bred dozens of strains of Fujis<s>
to hone its color, taste and shelf life.<s>
Now the best of them age as gracefully as Grannies, the industry's gold standard for storability.<s>
In the cornucopia of go-go apples, the Fuji's track record stands out:<s>
During the past 15 years, it has gone from almost zilch to some 50% of Japan's market.<s>
"The Japanese apple market is very keyed to high quality,"<s>
says David Lane, a scientist at a Canadian horticulture research center in Summerland, British Columbia,<s>
and so apples are more of a delicacy there than a big food commodity.<s>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates<s>
that this year Americans will eat about 40% more fresh apples per capita than the Japanese.<s>
The Fuji is still small potatoes in the U.S.,<s>
sold mainly in fruit boutiques.<s>
But in California,<s>
says Craig Ito, a Fuji-apple grower,<s>
"There's a Fuji apple cult.<s>
Once somebody eats one,<s>
they get hooked."<s>
Mr. Auvil, the Washington grower, says<s>
that he could sell Fujis to Taiwan buyers at $40 a box<s>
if he had them.<s>
(Taiwan already is a big importer of Fujis from other places,<s>
he adds.)<s>
But his first crop won't be picked till next year.<s>
"I expect to see the demand exceed supply for Fujis for the next 10 to 15 years,"<s>
he adds.<s>
Washington Red Delicious, by the way, are wholesaling for less than $10 a box these days.<s>
Mr. Auvil sees Fujis, in part,<s>
as striking a blow against the perversion of U.S. apples by supermarkets.<s>
"When the chain stores took over,<s>
there was no longer a connection between grower and consumer.<s>
A guy is sitting up in an office<s>
deciding<s>
what you're going to eat."<s>
After all, until the 1950s even the Red Delicious was a firm, delectable morsel.<s>
Then,<s>
as growers bred them more for looks,<s>
and to satisfy supermarket chains' demands of long-term storage,<s>
the Red went into decline.<s>
Now, those red applelike things<s>
stores sell in summer<s>
are fruitbowl lovely,<s>
but usually not good eating.<s>
They do deserve respect, however<s>
-- they are almost a year old, probably equal to about 106 in human years.<s>
The Fuji,<s>
to be sure,<s>
has blemishes too.<s>
It ripens later than most apples,<s>
and growing it in U.S. areas with chilly autumns may be tricky.<s>
Moreover, the frumpy Fuji must compete with an increasingly dolledup Delicious.<s>
Mr. Broderick, the Massachusetts grower, says<s>
the "big boss" at a supermarket chain even rejected his Red Delicious recently<s>
because they weren't waxed and brushed for extra shine.<s>
And he hadn't used hormones,<s>
which many growers employ<s>
to elongate their Delicious apples for greater eye appeal.<s>
Still,<s>
Mr. Auvil points out,<s>
Grannies became popular<s>
without big, red looks,<s>
so why not Fujis?<s>
He sees a shift in American values<s>
-- at least regarding apples --<s>
toward more emphasis on substance and less on glitz.<s>
"Taste has finally come to the fore,"<s>
he says.<s>
Or, for that matter, the core.<s>
