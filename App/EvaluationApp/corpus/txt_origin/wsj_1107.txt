This is in response to George Melloan's Business World column "The Housing Market Is a Bigger Mess <s>
Than You Think" <s>
(op-ed page, Sept. 26). <s>
In Houston, we have seen <s>
how bad the housing problem can become. <s>
Unused houses deteriorate rapidly, <s>
affecting the value of nearby homes; <s>
in a domino effect, the entire neighborhood can fall victim. <s>
At this stage some people just "walk away" from homes <s>
where the mortgage exceeds current market value. <s>
But most of them could have afforded to keep up their payments <s>
-- they chose not to do so. <s>
The problem is so vast <s>
that we need to try innovative solutions <s>
-- in small-scale experiments. <s>
Here are some ideas: <s>
1) Foreclosed homes could be sold by the FHA for no down payment <s>
(the biggest obstacle to young buyers), <s>
but with personal liability for the mortgage <s>
(no walking away by choice). <s>
2) Encourage long-term occupancy <s>
by forgiving one month's payment <s>
(off the tail end of the mortgage) <s>
for every six months paid; <s>
or perhaps have the down payment deferred to the end of the mortgage <s>
(balloon), <s>
but "forgiven" on a monthly pro-rata basis <s>
as long as the owner remains the occupant. <s>
3) Develop rental agreements with exclusive purchase options for the renter. <s>
An occupant will, in most every case, be better for the home and neighborhood than a vacant house. <s>
In this way, the house is not dumped on to a glutted market. <s>

The Federal Housing Administration, Veterans Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban Development further aggravate the problem of affordable housing stock <s>
by "buying in" to their foreclosed properties <s>
(of which there are, alas, many) <s>
at an inflated "balance due" <s>
-- say $80,000 on a house worth $55,000 -- <s>
instead of allowing a free market to price the house <s>
for what it's really worth. <s>
Worse, the properties then sit around <s>
deteriorating for maybe a year or so, <s>
but are resold eventually <s>
(because of the attractiveness of the low down payment, etc.) <s>
to a marginal buyer <s>
who can't afford both the mortgage and needed repairs; <s>
and having little vested interest <s>
that buyer will walk away <s>
and the vicious cycle repeats itself all over again. <s>
