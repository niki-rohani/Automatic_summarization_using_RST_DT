At Lloyd's of London, underwriters still scratch out policies <s>
using fountain pens and blotting paper. <s>
Visitors are ushered into the premises by red-frocked doormen <s>
known as waiters, <s>
a reminder of the insurance market's origins in a coffeehouse in 17th century London. <s>
Such trappings suggest a glorious past <s>
but give no hint of a troubled present. <s>
Lloyd's, once a pillar of the world insurance market, is being shaken to its very foundation. <s>
The 301-year-old exchange is battered by enormous claims from a decade-long run of unprecedented disasters, <s>
the most recent of which is last week's earthquake in California's Bay Area. <s>
At the same time, Lloyd's is besieged by disgruntled investors <s>
and hamstrung by inefficient but time-honored ways <s>
of conducting business. <s>
The exchange is gradually being squeezed into narrow, less-profitable segments of the market by less hidebound competitors. <s>
"Lloyd's is on the ropes," <s>
says Peter Nutting, a Lloyd's investor for 17 years <s>
who now leads a dissident group <s>
threatening to sue exchange underwriters for alleged mismanagement and negligence. <s>
"It needs more discipline. <s>
It needs to sort itself out." <s>
Most troublesome is the shrinking pool of "names," the well-heeled investors <s>
(some of them royal) <s>
who, as members of about 360 syndicates, underwrite policies. <s>
Some 1,750 members quit the exchange last year, more than triple the number of resignations in 1987. <s>
Names are resigning at an even faster pace this year. <s>
Lackluster returns are one reason. <s>
The average after-tax return on investment in 1986, the most recent year <s>
for which results are available, <s>
was 6.5%, <s>
according to Chatset Ltd., an insurance consulting firm in London. <s>
In 1985, it was 2.1%. <s>
Between 1981 and 1986, the most recent five-year period <s>
for which figures are available, <s>
Lloyd's reported over #3.6 billion in claims and reserves against future losses <s>
($5.7 billion at today's exchange rates), <s>
more than double the #1.35 billion posted in the previous five-year period. <s>
Many of the 31,329 investors <s>
who remain <s>
are beginning to question one of the exchange's most basic tenets, the concept of unlimited personal liability. <s>
Investors may reap huge profits <s>
when premiums exceed claims, <s>
but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe. <s>
And catastrophes are getting ever more costly. <s>
Lloyd's claims for the 1988 Piper Alpha oil-rig disaster in the North Sea, for instance, may reach $1 billion. <s>
During the five-year period <s>
ended 1986, <s>
roughly 80% of the names had money tied up in money-losing syndicates, <s>
according to Chatset consultants. <s>
The peril of unlimited liability looms large for a number of them now. <s>
"I have wished <s>
I could die <s>
and be out of it <s>
-- that's how bad it is," <s>
Betty Atkins, a secretary from suburban London, says. <s>
Ms. Atkins, <s>
whose Lloyd's membership was a bonus from a former employer in 1981, <s>
belongs to Mr. Nutting's dissident group on the Outhwaite syndicate, <s>
which has been hard hit by asbestos reinsurance claims. <s>
Ms. Atkins, <s>
who underwrote #20,000, or about $32,000, of insurance coverage on that syndicate, <s>
now faces potential losses of roughly #70,000, or $111,000. <s>
"If Lloyd's wants #70,000 out of me <s>
they will have to take everything I've got <s>
-- and even then I don't know <s>
if it will be enough," <s>
she says. <s>
Unease is widespread among exchange members. <s>
"I can't think of any reason <s>
to join Lloyd's now," <s>
says Keith Whitten, a British businessman and a Lloyd's member since 1979. <s>
"The downside is very considerable, <s>
and at the moment the upside is very marginal." <s>
If profits don't improve, <s>
Mr. Whitten says <s>
he may quit the exchange. <s>
Meanwhile, competition from rivals <s>
unencumbered by history <s>
is intensifying. <s>
Lloyd's is being squeezed out of low-margin but more consistently profitable product lines such as primary property and marine insurance. <s>
Over the past decade, competitors have chipped away at the exchange's share of the #2.5 billion marine market in London, <s>
where half the world's ships are insured. <s>
Lloyd's 66% stake in that market has shrunk to 50% in that period, <s>
according to an official at the Institute of London Underwriters, a Lloyd's competitor. <s>
(The official asked not to be named.) <s>
Much of the business has gone to the institute, an association of more than 100 insurers, <s>
including Cigna Corp., Allianz Versicherungs AG of West Germany and Britain's Commercial Union Assurance PLC. <s>
Lloyd's has endured decades of genteel decline. <s>
At the peak of its power and influence a century ago, Lloyd's dominated the insurance world with a 50% stake. <s>
It virtually dictated how ships were to be built <s>
and it monitored commerce through a unrivaled intelligence network in ports around the globe. <s>
Today, Lloyd's share of the world market, <s>
excluding life insurance, <s>
is about 2%. <s>
(Its stake is even smaller <s>
if life insurance is included.) <s>
Bigger rivals, such as Aetna and Allianz, <s>
backed by armies of statisticians <s>
using computers in hundreds of branches, <s>
operate more efficiently <s>
and often can offer lower rates, <s>
brokers say. <s>
Though Lloyd's pioneered such now-standard policies as worker's compensation insurance, burglary insurance for homeowners and businesses, and bankers' liability insurance, <s>
competitors now underwrite most of that business. <s>
Beyond that, many big oil, chemical and airline companies are siphoning off big chunks of the market <s>
by insuring themselves through "captive" offshore companies for industry-specific coverage. <s>
Even Lloyd's specialty <s>
-- unusually risky ventures -- <s>
is being challenged. <s>
Only 10 years ago, for instance, Lloyd's was the pre-eminent insurer of thoroughbred horses. <s>
But since 1981, Kirk Horse Insurance Inc. of Lexington, Ky. has grabbed a 20% stake of the market. <s>
Ronald Kirk, president, says <s>
Lloyd's has suffered <s>
because its structure doesn't allow underwriters to deal directly with clients; <s>
brokers are required intermediaries. <s>
Thus, <s>
he asserts, <s>
Lloyd's can't react quickly to competition. <s>
"Lloyd's has lost control of the situation," <s>
he says. <s>
"They aren't controlling their destiny <s>
like they used to." <s>
Murray Lawrence, Lloyd's chairman, agrees <s>
the exchange faces big challenges. <s>
"This is a watershed time, <s>
and we are trying to plot our way ahead," <s>
he says. <s>
"We have been a great market <s>
for inventing risks <s>
which other people then take, copy <s>
and cut rates." <s>
Lloyd's, <s>
he says, <s>
is cut off from "the vast body of premium down at the bottom end <s>
which acts as a steadying influence" against catastrophic losses. <s>
By that, he means low-margin but low-risk products such as certain types of primary property insurance. <s>
The exchange, <s>
he says, <s>
must find new products and new markets. <s>
That won't be an easy task. <s>
Tradition is dictator at Lloyd's. <s>
Three years ago, the exchange took up residence in a space-age tower of steel and glass <s>
-- evocative of the kind of modern architecture <s>
that Britain's Prince Charles has denounced. <s>
(Some exchange wags call the building "the oil rig.") <s>
But along with such treasured artifacts as Lord Nelson's spyglass, Lloyd's also brought its outmoded ways <s>
of doing business. <s>
The Lloyd's market actively underwrites insurance just 4 1/2 hours a day, <s>
brokers say. <s>
Underwriting doesn't get under way until after morning tea at 10 a.m. <s>
A two-hour lunch break follows. <s>
Things wind down at about 4:30 p.m., just in time for afternoon tea. <s>
Lloyd's vast trading hall houses a warren of well-polished desks. <s>
The hall's few computers are used <s>
mostly to send messages. <s>
Sandwiched between desks, <s>
underwriters sit on benches <s>
surrounded by stacks of policies. <s>
Brokers <s>
clutching thick folders <s>
stand in lines, <s>
waiting their turn <s>
to speak to the underwriters. <s>
A broker may have to approach as many as 20 underwriters <s>
who insure the endeavors on behalf of the syndicates. <s>
It could take six months for a claim to be paid. <s>
"The system," <s>
says Nicholas Samengo-Turner, a Lloyd's broker <s>
who left the exchange in 1985, <s>
"is so ludicrously unprofessional <s>
it drives you mad." <s>
Some maintain <s>
underwriters also have been inept. <s>
John Wetherell, a Lloyd's underwriter, says <s>
he and his fellow underwriters underestimated by as much as 50% the premiums <s>
they should have charged for property risks from 1980 to 1985. <s>
"How unprofessional we must have appeared to the outside world <s>
-- how incompetent at risk assessment and evaluation," <s>
he says. <s>
Lloyd's officials decline to comment on the matter. <s>
More recently, property rates have increased. <s>
Many at Lloyd's expect <s>
the San Francisco earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further. <s>
But it will be years <s>
before it is clear whether higher rates will offset the payouts for such disasters. <s>
The magnitude of the exchange's problems may not become known for some time <s>
because of Lloyd's practice <s>
of leaving the books open for three years <s>
to allow for the settlement of claims. <s>
Lloyd's only recently reported its financial results for 1986. <s>
That year, it posted record pretax profit of #650 million, a gain <s>
it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims. <s>
But Mr. Lawrence says <s>
reported profit will be down in 1987, 1988 and 1989, <s>
though he declines to specify <s>
how steep the decline will be. <s>
Insurance analysts say <s>
the exchange's downturn in profitability is likely to be aggravated by more than $600 million in aviation losses <s>
(including the 1988 Pan Am airline disaster over Lockerbie, Scotland) <s>
and a still-uncalculated chunk of claims from September's Hurricane Hugo. <s>
Lloyd's says <s>
the departures of names isn't likely to hurt its underwriting capacity, currently about #11 billion. <s>
Mr. Lawrence says <s>
the drain of funds has been offset by an increase in investments by the remaining names. <s>
Meanwhile, the exchange has been trying to lower costs. <s>
(It recently cut its work force by 9%, or 213.) <s>
But Lloyd's is hampered in its efforts <s>
to overhaul operations <s>
by its reluctance <s>
to embrace modern technology. <s>
Mr. Wetherell, the underwriter, reckons <s>
half of his business could be transacted by computer, <s>
cutting costs at least 10%. <s>
Though Lloyd's has talked for years about computerizing underwriting transactions, <s>
the effort hasn't gotten very far. <s>
Competition among underwriters and brokers makes them loath to centralize price and policy information. <s>
Both groups cling to traditional face-to-face dealings, even for routine policies. <s>
Lloyd's overblown bureaucracy also hampers efforts <s>
to update marketing strategies. <s>
Some underwriters have been pressing for years to tap the low-margin business <s>
by selling some policies directly to consumers. <s>
Lloyd's presently sells only auto insurance directly to the public, <s>
and such policies are sold only in limited markets such as the U.K. and Canada. <s>
But such changes must be cleared by four internal committees and dozens of underwriters, brokers and administrators <s>
before being implemented. <s>
The proposal <s>
to sell directly to the public <s>
remains mired in bureaucratic quicksand. <s>
Lloyd's is moving forward on some fronts, though. <s>
Mr. Lawrence says <s>
the exchange is updating some procedures <s>
to make speedier payments on claims. <s>
By next year, all underwriters will be linked to a communications network <s>
that could reduce paper work on claims. <s>
