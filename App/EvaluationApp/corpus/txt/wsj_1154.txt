When the good fairy <s>
assigned to Slovakia <s>
hovered over the cradle of Edita Gruberova many years ago in Bratislava, <s>
she sprinkled her with high E flats, sparkling Ds, clean trills, and coloratura ornaments silvery as magic dust. <s>
Maybe she could drop by at the Metropolitan Opera <s>
and bring along what she forgot, a little charm, a few smidgins of thespian skills and a nice wig. <s>
Cast as Violetta Valery in a new production of Verdi's "La Traviata," <s>
Ms. Gruberova last week did many things nicely and others not so well. <s>
It isn't every day that we hear a Violetta <s>
who can sing the first act's high-flying music with all the little notes <s>
perfectly pitched <s>
and neatly stitched together. <s>
Never once did she gasp for air <s>
or mop her brow. <s>
She was as cool as a cucumber. <s>
But <s>
as you may know, <s>
things are not going well for Violetta. <s>
There are times <s>
when she must show a little emotion. <s>
She has TB, after all, and a weak-kneed lover; <s>
and though a successful courtesan, she is just about overdrawn at the bank. <s>
Worse, her walls move all the time <s>
-- at least in this production. <s>
Just when Ms. Gruberova sat down away from her guests <s>
to cough in private, <s>
her salon began sliding around the stage; <s>
her country hideaway also has a very active set of drapes. <s>
Hold on to those funny braids! <s>
you wanted to caution her <s>
as the sets started to roll around once more. <s>
This is the most moving "Traviata" <s>
I've ever seen. <s>
Normally, Violetta can go about her business <s>
without wondering <s>
whether she is moving as gracefully as the scenery. <s>
But this is a production <s>
designed and directed by Franco Zeffirelli <s>
and paid for by Sybil Harrington, <s>
who has no need to count her pennies, <s>
unlike Violetta, down to 20 louis at the opera's end. <s>
Seeing all those millions in action, <s>
I was just so relieved <s>
that Ms. Gruberova, <s>
gawky thing that she is, <s>
didn't accidentally smother herself in a drape. <s>
Large and lavish, "Traviata" is another addition to the Met's growing stock of cast-proof productions mostly by Mr. Zeffirelli. <s>
They have a life of their own <s>
and can be counted on to look good and perform <s>
whenever a cast isn't up to either. <s>
If a strike ever hits the Met, <s>
the company can still sell tickets to his "Boheme" and "Turandot" <s>
and boom out recordings <s>
(of another era). <s>
Last week's discerning audience gave a bigger hand to a greenhouse than to the tenor Neil Shicoff, <s>
who sang an aria inside it. <s>
Inexplicably costumed as a rabbinical student, <s>
tottering around on lifts, <s>
Mr. Shicoff hardly seemed the fellow <s>
to catch a fancy cocotte's eye. <s>
I wish <s>
he could wear lifts in his voice. <s>
Not nearly in his best form, the tenor made dullish sounds along with his usual clumsy hand gestures. <s>
Maybe Mr. Z. was too busy taming his set <s>
to work with his naturally ungainly Alfredo. <s>
Or is it that Mr. Z. is getting a little tired of "Traviata"? <s>
This is the same production <s>
already seen in Paris and Florence, <s>
and its scenic ideas echo the movie <s>
he made with Placido Domingo and Teresa Stratas. <s>
Decades earlier, Maria Callas sang the Dallas staging <s>
that introduced the flashback idea. <s>
In an invention <s>
that drives Verdi purists bananas, <s>
Violetta lies dying in bed during the prelude, <s>
rising deliriously <s>
when then she remembers the great parties <s>
she used to throw. <s>
The entire opera is her dream. <s>
Given the prelude's thematic connections with the music <s>
preceding the last act, <s>
the idea is more worn than bad, <s>
though <s>
as luck would have it, <s>
for a change there actually was a conductor in the pit <s>
whom we wanted to hear, <s>
Carlos Kleiber, <s>
trying to make memorable music <s>
while we all waited for the bed lump to stir into song. <s>
Once she did so, <s>
the big-souled German maestro with the shaky nerves <s>
who so often cancels <s>
offered a limpid, flowing performance <s>
that in its unswagged and unswaggering approach was totally at odds with the staging. <s>
Of heart-pounding moments there were nearly none, <s>
and whether this has to do with Mr. Kleiber or the wooden cast is hard to say. <s>
In any event, Ms. Gruberova barely ventilated Violetta's anguish in her long meeting with Wolfgang Brendel, <s>
who as Germont seemed fairly desperate <s>
trying to inject an Italianate lilt into his heavy, teutonic baritone. <s>
"Di Provenza" wasn't much of an advertisement for sunny, southern France. <s>
Perhaps Mr. Kleiber could let him substitute one of the songs about dead children and dark nights from Mahler's "Kindertotenlieder." <s>
Speaking of dark nights, <s>
the Met's next-door neighbor, the New York City Opera, has canceled its season <s>
after failing to reach a settlement with its musicians, <s>
who wanted pay parity with the the Chicago Lyric and San Francisco Opera orchestras. <s>
Well, they can now go and audition there. <s>
Good luck. <s>
Common sense suggests <s>
that people who play for a company <s>
that charges about half <s>
what those houses do for a ticket <s>
are not in the same market. <s>
The cancellation bodes poorly for a company <s>
already beset with an identity crisis <s>
exacerbated by the retirement of general director Beverly Sills and the amazing appointment of Christopher Keene as her successor <s>
after his years of feckless toiling in the pit. <s>
As the Met discovered years ago <s>
following a belated December opening, <s>
it is nearly impossible to recapture subscribers <s>
once they have had time <s>
to ponder their entertainment choices. <s>
I, for instance, was perfectly happy at Avery Fisher Hall the other day <s>
listening to Helmuth Rilling conduct the Messa per Rossini, a strange piece <s>
written by 13 different Italian composers <s>
to honor Rossini after his death in 1868. <s>
Each of them contributed a section at the behest of Verdi, <s>
who was nearly driven to his own early grave by the troublesome arrangements. <s>
For all that, the piece landed unperformed in a dusty archive <s>
after Bologna refused to supply a chorus and orchestra. <s>
We know <s>
Verdi's own contribution was mighty impressive <s>
since the operatic "Libera me" was reworked for the Manzoni Requiem, <s>
of which he wrote every note himself <s>
having learned his lesson. <s>
The surprising discovery of the evening at Fisher was the high standard <s>
achieved by some of his now-obscure colleagues, notably Raimondo Boucheron. <s>
His melodious "Confutatis" was smoothly sung by bass Brian Matthews. <s>
Also, Teodulo Mabellini's "Lux aeterna" was intriguingly scored <s>
and splendidly put across by Mr. Rilling. <s>
He brought along his Stuttgart-based Gaechinger Kantorei chorus, and even better, the Czech soprano Gabriela Benackova. <s>
She was in her most radiant, expressive voice. <s>
Maybe she could step across the plaza to the Met <s>
-- where she has still to make her debut -- <s>
and help out her Czech compatriot <s>
by singing the slow parts of "Traviata." <s>
The Tokyo International Film Festival was no match for the Cannes Film Festival in terms of prestige, <s>
but it made its mark: <s>
It awarded the largest cash prize of any film festival to young and first-time film makers. <s>
At this year's event, the third since the festival got under way in 1985, Idrissa Ouedraogo of Burkina Faso won the Sakura Gold prize of $143,000 for "Yaaba" <s>
("Old Woman"). <s>
By comparison, Cannes now gives $39,000 to the winner of its young director's award. <s>
Says director George Miller <s>
("Mad Max"): <s>
"I think <s>
the Tokyo festival may become known as a major attraction for young directors <s>
because of the money as well as the recognition." <s>
There are drawbacks. <s>
Vincent Tolentino, a correspondent for the French magazine Telerama, says of the recently ended Tokyo festival: <s>
"No one makes deals . . . <s>
and most of the films have been seen before at other festivals." <s>
Belgium decided <s>
that investors <s>
who demand the delivery of their securities <s>
when they buy shares or domestic bonds <s>
will have to pay an additional 100 Belgian francs <s>
(about $2.60) <s>
for each transaction, <s>
bringing the total fee to 200 francs. <s>
While no figures exist, <s>
it is thought that many small investors in Belgium store securities privately, <s>
in some cases to avoid paying high inheritance taxes. <s>
The law could redound to the advantage of brokers and banks, <s>
who incur high administrative costs to deliver securities to investors. <s>
Japan is considering giving aid to Hungary and Poland <s>
to support their recent political reforms, <s>
a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said. <s>
"This is the first time, <s>
if we decide to do so, <s>
for Japan to extend aid of this kind to Eastern European countries," <s>
the spokesman said. <s>
He said <s>
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu also is studying the possibility of a visit to the two Eastern bloc nations and to Western Europe next January. <s>
Drugs were a major issue in two days of talks between French President Francois Mitterrand and Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez. <s>
"I demand the utmost severity in the fight against drug traffickers," <s>
President Mitterrand said after the meeting in Valladolid, Spain. <s>
He added: <s>
"Banks must open their books." <s>
The leaders' talks coincided with a meeting in Madrid of anti-drug experts from the U.S., France, Italy, Spain, Peru, Bolivia and Colombia. <s>
That conference, <s>
which began yesterday, <s>
was expected to cover such matters as police training and extradition agreements, <s>
Spanish officials said. <s>
Three Soviet government officials <s>
-- the ministers of railroads, of foreign economic relations and of heavy-machine building -- <s>
will visit Tehran next month for talks, <s>
Iran's official news agency reported. <s>
Under an agreement <s>
signed last June, <s>
the Soviets will help Iran in oil exploration and other areas in return for exports of Iranian natural gas. <s>
And in Paris, Mahmoud Vaezi, Iran's vice minister of foreign affairs, began a five-day visit <s>
to discuss such matters as compensation to French enterprises for contracts <s>
broken by the Khomeini regime. <s>
Toto Co., a Japanese ceramics maker, has developed a toilet <s>
that can check the user's health. <s>
A Toto spokesman said <s>
the toilet not only tests blood pressure, pulse and urine, <s>
it also stores the data for up to 130 days. <s>
Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. and Omron Tateisi Electronics are involved with Toto's new product, <s>
which will go on the market in about two years time. <s>
"It will be very expensive," <s>
the spokesman warned. <s>
"The price cannot be less than $7,000." <s>
Since Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office last December, <s>
special agents have arrested more than 6,000 federal employees on charges <s>
ranging from extortion to tax evasion. <s>
Hector Castaneda Jimenez, chief prosecutor at the Attorney General's Office, said <s>
that an estimated $82.8 million in government property and unpaid taxes have been recovered in the campaign <s>
to root out official corruption. <s>
Mr. Castaneda's office will reportedly issue warrants during the next six months for the arrest of another 10,000 federal employees. <s>
Those employees are suspected of illegally gaining an estimated $376.8 million, <s>
the prosecutor was quoted as saying by the Excelsior news service. <s>
He added <s>
that federal agents hope to recover at least half that amount. <s>
"The rest will probably not be recoverable <s>
either because the statute of limitations expired <s>
or because many prefer to spend additional time in jail <s>
rather than return the money," <s>
the prosecutor said. <s>
The United Nations, <s>
which is distributing farm tools to returning refugees in Namibia, <s>
is rethinking a plan <s>
to hand out machetes <s>
because of the tense political climate during preparations for independence from South Africa. <s>
"The decision <s>
to distribute machetes at this time, <s>
which could be used as weapons, <s>
is under review," <s>
said a U.N. spokesman. . . . <s>
Sources close to the family of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said <s>
she is expecting a second child, probably early next year. <s>
