The dollar finished lower yesterday,<s>
after tracking another rollercoaster session on Wall Street.<s>
Concern about the volatile U.S. stock market had faded in recent sessions,<s>
and traders appeared content to let the dollar languish in a narrow range until tomorrow,<s>
when the preliminary report on third-quarter U.S. gross national product is released.<s>
But seesaw gyrations in the Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday put Wall Street back in the spotlight<s>
and inspired market participants to bid the U.S. unit lower.<s>
UAL's decision<s>
to remain an independent company<s>
sent share prices tumbling.<s>
By midmorning, the DJIA had plunged 80 points<s>
and foreign-exchange dealers quickly drove the dollar down.<s>
When the DJIA modestly rebounded,<s>
the dollar bounced back in choppy dealings<s>
but ended the day below the levels of late Monday.<s>
Stock prices, meanwhile, posted significant gains in later trading<s>
and closed down by only 3.69 points on the day.<s>
Some dealers said<s>
that the market's strong reaction to Wall Street reflects a general uneasiness about the dollar.<s>
They added<s>
that the DJIA's swift drop proved an easy excuse for the market<s>
to drive the U.S. currency in the direction<s>
it was already headed.<s>
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.8355 marks, down from 1.8470 marks Monday, and at 141.45 yen, down from 141.90 yen late Monday.<s>
Sterling was quoted at $1.6055, up from $1.6030 late Monday.<s>
In Tokyo Wednesday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.57 yen, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 142.10 yen.<s>
Tom Trettien, a vice president with Banque Paribas in New York, sees a break in the dollar's long-term upward trend, a trend<s>
that began in January 1988.<s>
He argues<s>
that the dollar is now "moving sideways,"<s>
adding<s>
that "the next leg could be the beginning of a longer term bearish phase."<s>
Analysts peg the dollar's recent weakness to an underlying slowdown in the U.S. economy,<s>
highlighted by recent economic data, particularly a surprisingly sharp widening in the August U.S. trade gap.<s>
They also point out<s>
that narrowing interest-rate differentials between the U.S. and its major trading partners tend to make the U.S. currency less attractive to foreign investors.<s>
Despite several spurts of dollar trading,<s>
it was noted that mark-yen cross trade grabbed much of the market's attention.<s>
Following the dive in U.S. stocks,<s>
the mark has strengthened more than its major counterparts.<s>
Traders attribute the mark's surge to a robust West German economy and higher rate differentials.<s>
But, they add<s>
that the mark's strength is in part a reflection of a shift away from U.S. assets by Japanese investors into West German investments.<s>
"The question remains:<s>
how much can the West German market absorb?"<s>
says one senior dealer.<s>
Some dealers say<s>
that Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita's reassurance<s>
that Japanese monetary policy won't be changed for the time being<s>
has given investors an added excuse<s>
to push the yen down even further against the mark.<s>
Despite the yen's weakness with respect to the mark,<s>
Tokyo traders say<s>
they don't expect the Bank of Japan to take any action<s>
to support the Japanese currency on that front.<s>
Meanwhile, sterling slumped on news<s>
that the United Kingdom posted a wider-than-expected trade deficit in September.<s>
The news also knocked the British unit to below 2.95 marks in London,<s>
but a bout of short-covering helped sterling recoup some of its earlier losses.<s>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery jumped $3.20 to $370.20 an ounce.<s>
The close was the highest since Aug. 15.<s>
Estimated volume was a light two million ounces.<s>
In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $368.25 an ounce.<s>
