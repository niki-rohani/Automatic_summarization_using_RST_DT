The bond market, <s>
which sometimes thrives on bad news, <s>
cheered yesterday's stock market sell-off and perceptions <s>
that the economy is growing weaker. <s>
Early in the day, bonds rose modestly on economists' forecasts <s>
that this week's slate of economic data will portray an economy headed for trouble. <s>
Such news is good for bonds <s>
because economic weakness sometimes causes the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in an effort <s>
to stimulate the economy <s>
and stave off a recession. <s>
For example, today the Department of Commerce is scheduled to release the September durable goods report. <s>
The consensus forecast of 14 economists <s>
surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report <s>
is for a 1.2% drop in September orders. <s>
That would follow a 3.9% advance in August. <s>
Bonds received a bigger boost later in the day <s>
when stock prices moved broadly lower. <s>
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 26.23 points to 2662.91. <s>
"Bond investors have been watching stocks closely," <s>
said Joel Marver, chief fixed-income analyst at Technical Data Global Markets Group. <s>
"When you get a big sell-off in equities, <s>
money starts to shift into bonds," <s>
which are considered safer, <s>
he said. <s>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended about 1/2 point higher, or up about $5 for each $1,000 face amount, <s>
while the yield slid to 7.93% from 7.98% Friday. <s>
Municipals ended mixed, <s>
while mortgage-backed and investment-grade corporate bonds rose. <s>
Prices of high-yield, high-risk corporate securities ended unchanged. <s>
In more evidence of the growing division between "good" and "bad" junk bonds, a $150 million issue by Imo Industries Inc. was snapped up by investors <s>
while underwriters for Beatrice Co. 's $350 million issue are considering restructuring the deal <s>
to attract buyers. <s>
In the Treasury market, analysts expect bond prices to trade in narrow ranges this week <s>
as the market takes in positive and negative news. <s>
"On the negative side, the market will be affected by constant supply in all sectors of the market," <s>
said William M. Brachfeld, economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. <s>
"On the other hand, we have economic news <s>
that is {expected to be} relatively positive for the bond market. <s>
We will go back and forth with a tilt toward slightly lower yields," <s>
he said. <s>
Today, the Treasury will sell $10 billion of new two-year notes. <s>
Tomorrow, Resolution Funding Corp., a division of a new government agency <s>
created <s>
to bail out the nation's troubled thrifts, <s>
will hold its first bond auction <s>
at which it will sell $4.5 billion of 30-year bonds. <s>
So far, money managers and other bond buyers haven't shown much interest in the Refcorp bonds. <s>
Analysts have mixed views about the two-year note auction. <s>
While some say <s>
the auction should proceed smoothly, <s>
others contend <s>
that yesterday's sale of $2.58 billion of asset-backed securities by Ford Motor Credit Corp. may have siphoned some potential institutional buyers from the government's note sale. <s>
The division of auto maker Ford Motor Co. made its debut in the asset-backed securities market with the second-largest issue in the market's four-year history. <s>
The company offered securities <s>
backed by automobile loans through an underwriting group <s>
headed by First Boston Corp. <s>
The issue yields 8.90% <s>
and carries a guarantee <s>
covering 9% of the deal from the company. <s>
First Boston sweetened the terms from the original yield estimate in an apparent effort <s>
to place the huge offering. <s>
The issue was offered at a yield nearly one percentage point above the yield on two-year Treasurys. <s>
The only asset-backed deal larger than Ford's was a $4 billion offering by General Motors Acceptance Corp. in 1986. <s>
Treasury Securities <s>
Treasury bonds were 1/8 to 1/2 point higher yesterday in light trading. <s>
The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 102 3/32, <s>
compared with 101 17/32 Friday. <s>
The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 17/32 <s>
to yield 7.90%, <s>
compared with 100 3/32 <s>
to yield 7.97%. <s>
The latest two-year notes were quoted late at 100 28/32 <s>
to yield 7.84%. <s>
Short-term rates rose yesterday at the government's weekly Treasury bill auction, <s>
compared with the previous bill sale. <s>
The Treasury sold $7.81 billion of three-month bills with an average discount rate of 7.52%, the highest since the average of 7.63% at the auction on Oct. 10. <s>
The $7.81 billion of six-month Treasury bills were sold with an average discount rate of 7.50%, the highest since the average of 7.60% at the Oct. 10 auction. <s>
The rates were up from last week's auction, <s>
when they were 7.37% and 7.42%, respectively. <s>
Here are auction details: <s>
Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. <s>
Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return <s>
while lower bidding widens it. <s>
The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, <s>
while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year. <s>
Both issues are dated Oct. 26. <s>
The 13-week bills mature Jan. 25, 1990, <s>
and the 26-week bills mature April 26, 1990. <s>
Corporate Issues <s>
Investment-grade corporates closed about 1/4 point higher in quiet trading. <s>
In the junk bond market, Imo Industries' issue of 12-year debentures, <s>
considered to be one of the market's high-quality credits, <s>
was priced at par to yield 12%. <s>
Peter Karches, managing director at underwriter Morgan Stanley & Co., said <s>
the issue was oversubscribed. <s>
"It's a segmented market, <s>
and <s>
if you have a good, strong credit, <s>
people have an appetite for it," <s>
he said. <s>
Morgan Stanley is expected to price another junk bond deal, $350 million of senior subordinated debentures by Continental Cablevision Inc., next Tuesday. <s>
In light of the recent skittishness in the high-yield market, junk bond analysts and traders expect other high-yield deals to be sweetened or restructured <s>
before they are offered to investors. <s>
In the case of Beatrice, Salomon Brothers Inc. is considering restructuring the reset mechanism on the $200 million portion of the offering. <s>
Under the originally contemplated terms of the offering, the notes would have been reset annually at a fixed spread above Treasurys. <s>
Under the new plan <s>
being considered, <s>
the notes would reset annually at a rate <s>
to maintain a market value of 101. <s>
Price talk calls for the reset notes to be priced at a yield of between 13 1/4% and 13 1/2%. <s>
Mortgage-Backed Securities <s>
Activity in derivative markets was strong with four new real estate mortgage investment conduits announced and talk of several more deals in today's session. <s>
The Federal National Mortgage Association offered $1.2 billion of Remic securities in three issues, <s>
and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. offered a $250 million Remic <s>
backed by 9% 15-year securities. <s>
Part of the reason for the heavy activity in derivative markets is that underwriters are repackaging mortgage securities <s>
being sold by thrifts. <s>
Traders said <s>
thrifts have stepped up their mortgage securities sales <s>
as the bond market has risen in the past two weeks. <s>
In the mortgage pass-through sector, active issues rose <s>
but trailed gains in the Treasury market. <s>
Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for November delivery were quoted late yesterday at 98 10/32, up 10/32; <s>
and Freddie Mac 9% securities were at 97 1/2, up 1/4. <s>
The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 8.36% to a 12-year average life assumption, <s>
as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note widened slightly to 1.46 percentage points. <s>
Municipals <s>
A $575 million San Antonio, Texas, electric and gas system revenue bond issue dominated the new issue sector. <s>
The refunding issue, <s>
which had been in the wings for two months, <s>
was one of the chief offerings <s>
overhanging the market <s>
and limiting price appreciation. <s>
But alleviating that overhang failed to stimulate much activity in the secondary market, <s>
where prices were off 1/8 to up 3/8 point. <s>
An official with lead underwriter First Boston said <s>
orders for the San Antonio bonds were "on the slow side." <s>
He attributed that to the issue's aggressive pricing and large size, as well as the general lethargy in the municipal marketplace. <s>
In addition, <s>
he noted, <s>
the issue would normally be the type <s>
purchased by property and casualty insurers, <s>
but recent disasters, such as Hurricane Hugo and the Northern California earthquake, have stretched insurers' resources <s>
and damped their demand for bonds. <s>
A $137.6 million Maryland Stadium Authority sports facilities lease revenue bond issue appeared to be off to a good start. <s>
The issue was oversubscribed <s>
and "doing very well," <s>
according to an official with lead underwriter Morgan Stanley. <s>
Activity quieted in the New York City bond market, <s>
where heavy investor selling last week drove yields on the issuer's full faith and credit backed bonds up as much as 0.50 percentage point. <s>
Foreign Bonds <s>
Japanese government bonds ended lower <s>
after the dollar rose modestly against the yen. <s>
The turnaround in the dollar fueled bearish sentiment about Japan's bond market. <s>
The benchmark No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers' screens at a price of 95.39, off 0.28. <s>
The yield rose to 5.38%. <s>
West German bond prices ended lower after a day of aimless trading. <s>
The benchmark 7% bond due October 1999 fell 0.20 point to 99.80 <s>
to yield 7.03%, <s>
while the 6 3/4% notes due July 1994 fell 0.10 to 97.65 <s>
to yield 7.34%. <s>
British government bonds ended slightly higher in quiet trading <s>
as investors looked ahead to today's British trade report. <s>
The benchmark 11 3/4% Treasury bond due 2003/2007 rose 1/8 to 111 21/32 <s>
to yield 10.11%, <s>
while the 12% issue of 1995 rose 3/32 to 103 23/32 <s>
to yield 11.01%. <s>
