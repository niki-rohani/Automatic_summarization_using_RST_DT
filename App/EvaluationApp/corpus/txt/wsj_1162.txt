People start their own businesses for many reasons. <s>
But a chance <s>
to fill out sales-tax records <s>
is rarely one of them. <s>
Red tape is the bugaboo of small business. <s>
Ironically, the person <s>
who wants to run his or her own business <s>
is probably the active, results-oriented sort most likely to hate meeting the rules and record-keeping demands of federal, state and local regulators. <s>
Yet every business owner has to face the mound of forms and regulations <s>
-- and often is the only one available to tackle it. <s>
There is hope of change. <s>
Last week, Sen. Malcolm Wallop <s>
(R., Wyo.) <s>
held hearings on a bill <s>
to strengthen an existing law <s>
designed to reduce regulatory hassles for small businesses. <s>
"A great many federal regulations are meant for larger entities <s>
and don't really apply to small businesses," <s>
says Marian Jacob, a legislative aide to Sen. Wallop. <s>
Other lawmakers are busy <s>
trying to revive the recently lapsed Paperwork Reduction Act, <s>
which many feel benefited small enterprises. <s>
Thus, optimistic entrepreneurs await a promised land of less red tape <s>
-- just as soon as Uncle Sam gets around to arranging it. <s>
Meanwhile, they tackle the mounds of paper <s>
-- and fantasize about a dream world <s>
where bulk-mail postal regulations and government inspectors are banished. <s>
To find out what red tape riles entrepreneurs most, <s>
the Journal asked a completely unscientific, random sample of business owners to fantasize about the forms and regulations <s>
they would most like to get lost in the mail. <s>
Some entrepreneurs say <s>
the red tape <s>
they most love to hate <s>
is red tape <s>
they would also hate to lose. <s>
They concede <s>
that much of the government meddling <s>
that torments them <s>
is essential to the public good, and even to their own businesses. <s>
Rules <s>
that set standards for products <s>
or govern business behavior, <s>
generally the best regarded form of red tape, "create a level playing field <s>
and keep unscrupulous competitors away," <s>
says Sidney West, president of TechDesign International Inc., a Springfield, Va., business <s>
that designs telecommunication and other products. <s>
Mr. West cites the Federal Communications Commission and its standards for telecommunications equipment: <s>
"They monitor product quality <s>
and prevent junk from flooding the market." <s>
Some gripes about red tape are predictable: <s>
Architects complain about a host of building regulations, <s>
auto leasing companies about car insurance rules. <s>
Determining when handicapped access is required can be a nightmare for architects, <s>
says Mark Dooling, president of Dooling & Co., a Newton, Mass., architectural firm. <s>
There is such a maze of federal, state and local codes <s>
that "building inspectors are backing away from interpreting them," <s>
Mr. Dooling says. <s>
Taxi, leasing and other companies <s>
that maintain fleets of vehicles <s>
devote substantial resources to complying with state insurance laws and a host of agencies. <s>
"It's very costly and time-consuming," <s>
says Phil Rosen, a partner in Fleet & Leasing Management Inc., a Boston car-leasing company. <s>
One senior executive at his firm spends nearly 20% of his time on insurance, <s>
he says. <s>
Other forms of red tape are more pervasive. <s>
The most onerous, <s>
many entrepreneurs say, <s>
is the record-keeping and filing <s>
required by tax authorities. <s>
Complying with environmental and workplace regulations runs a close second. <s>
But gripes run the gamut. <s>
Here is the red tape <s>
that irks surveyed business owners the most: <s>
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS: <s>
Next to medical insurance, "costs of compliance" are the fastest-growing expense at Impco Inc., a Providence, R.I., chemical company. <s>
Peter Gebhard, the company's owner, says <s>
spending on regulatory paper work and the people <s>
to do it <s>
-- mostly to comply with federal, state and local environmental laws -- <s>
will rise almost 30% this year to $100,000. <s>
Mr. Gebhard adds <s>
that spending on environmental red tape amounts to between 6.5% and 7.5% of Impco's total operating expenses. <s>
Eastern Reproduction Corp., a Waltham, Mass., maker of thin metal precision parts, must report to five federal and state agencies as well as to local fire, police, hospital and plumbing authorities, <s>
says Robert Maguire, president. <s>
One state environmental regulator returned a report <s>
because "it wasn't heavy enough, <s>
it couldn't have been correct," <s>
Mr. Maguire says. <s>
WITHHOLDING RULES: <s>
Employers must deposit withholding taxes <s>
exceeding $3,000 <s>
within three days after payroll <s>
-- or pay stiff penalties -- <s>
and that's a big problem for small businesses. <s>
It's especially nettlesome <s>
"if you're on the road <s>
and you're the one responsible," <s>
says Eddie Brown, president of Brown Capital Management Inc., a Baltimore money-management firm. <s>
EMPLOYEE MANUALS: <s>
Revising employee manuals on pensions, health care and other subjects costs over $25,000 a year for Bert Giguiere, president of Professional Agricultural Management Inc., a Fresno, Calif., provider of business services to farmers. <s>
An employer leaves itself open to a great deal of liability <s>
if its employee manuals don't reflect the most recent laws, <s>
he says. <s>
But the ever-changing laws are usually so complicated and confusing <s>
that "you need professionals <s>
to help you; <s>
you can't do it yourself," <s>
he adds. <s>
PENSION AND PROFIT-SHARING RULES: <s>
Complying with these is enough <s>
to make business owners look forward to their own pension days. <s>
Yearly changes in federal benefit laws force small businesses to repeatedly re-evaluate and redesign existing plans. <s>
Alice Fixx, <s>
who runs her own public-relations concern in New York, <s>
says <s>
she has had to overhaul her pension and profit-sharing plans three times in the past three years. <s>
"It doesn't increase benefits, <s>
but it's costly and time-consuming," <s>
Ms. Fixx says. <s>
Compliance added 15% to 20% to her accounting bill last year, <s>
she says. <s>
SALES TAX RECORDS: <s>
Advertising agencies and other service companies are exempt from city and state sales tax in most locales <s>
-- but the exemption comes at a price of exhaustive records and rigorous reviews. <s>
To justify their exempt status <s>
and avoid penalties, <s>
these businesses must show once a year <s>
that each and every transaction <s>
on which they didn't pay sales tax <s>
was a legitimate business expense. <s>
"You need one person <s>
to just take care of sales tax," <s>
says Jennie Tong, executive vice president of Lee Liu & Tong Advertising Inc., New York. <s>
