Atco Ltd. said <s>
its utilities arm is considering building new electric power plants, <s>
some valued at more than one billion Canadian dollars <s>
(US$851 million), <s>
in Great Britain and elsewhere. <s>
C.S. Richardson, Atco's senior vice president, finance, said <s>
its 50.1%-owned Canadian Utilities Ltd. unit is reviewing cogeneration projects in eastern Canada, and conventional electric power generating plants elsewhere, <s>
including Britain, <s>
where the British government plans to allow limited competition in electrical generation from private-sector suppliers as part of its privatization program. <s>
"The projects are big. <s>
They can be C$1 billion plus," <s>
Mr. Richardson said. <s>
"But we wouldn't go into them alone," <s>
and Canadian Utilities' equity stake would be small, <s>
he said. <s>
"Ideally, we'd like to be the operator {of the project} and a modest equity investor. <s>
Our long suit is our proven ability <s>
to operate" power plants, <s>
he said. <s>
Mr. Richardson wouldn't offer specifics <s>
regarding Atco's proposed British project, <s>
but he said <s>
it would compete for customers with two huge British power generating companies <s>
that would be formed under the country's plan <s>
to privatize its massive water and electric utilities. <s>
Britain's government plans to raise about #20 billion <s>
($31.05 billion) <s>
from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities, <s>
beginning next month. <s>
The planned electric utility sale, <s>
scheduled for next year, <s>
is alone expected to raise #13 billion, <s>
making it the world's largest public offering. <s>
Under terms of the plan, independent generators would be able to compete for 15% of customers until 1994, and for another 10% between 1994 and 1998. <s>
Canadian Utilities had 1988 revenue of C$1.16 billion, mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in Alberta, <s>
where the company serves about 800,000 customers. <s>
"There seems to be a move around the world <s>
to deregulate the generation of electricity," <s>
Mr. Richardson said, <s>
and Canadian Utilities hopes to capitalize on it. <s>
"This is a real thrust on our utility side," <s>
he said, <s>
adding <s>
that Canadian Utilities is also mulling projects in underdeveloped countries, <s>
though he would be specific. <s>
Canadian Utilities isn't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in Britain, in anticipation of the privatization program. <s>
"We're certainly looking at some power generating projects in England," <s>
said Bruce Stram, vice president, corporate strategy and corporate planning, with Enron Corp., Houston, a big natural gas producer and pipeline operator. <s>
Mr. Stram said <s>
Enron is considering building gas-fired power plants in the U.K. capable of producing about 500 megawatts of power at a cost of about $300 million to $400 million. <s>
