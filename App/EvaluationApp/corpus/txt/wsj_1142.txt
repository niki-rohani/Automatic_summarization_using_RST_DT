The Nasdaq over-the-counter market didn't fully recover from a selling stampede, <s>
and closed down 1.2%. <s>
The effects on the market of the mostly computer-driven sell-off among exchange-listed stocks irked many market makers, <s>
who watched the Nasdaq Composite Index tumble in sympathy with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, <s>
and then saw it get left behind in the subsequent rally. <s>
After plummeting 1.8% at one point during the day, <s>
the composite rebounded a little, <s>
but finished down 5.52, at 461.70. <s>
In contrast, the industrial average recovered almost completely from its skid <s>
and closed down 0.1%. <s>
The New York Stock Exchange Composite was 0.4% lower for the day. <s>
As usual, the over-the-counter market's biggest technology stocks were hardest hit. <s>
Microsoft, <s>
battered by profit taking in recent sessions, <s>
sank as much as 4; <s>
but it finished at 80 7/8, down 2 1/4 on volume of one million shares. <s>
MCI Communications, the most active issue, finished down 5/8 to 42 1/8. <s>
MCI traded as low as 41 3/8 during the session. <s>
Other active stocks included Jaguar, <s>
whose American depositary receipts added 1/8 to 11 1/4. <s>
Apple Computer improved 7/8 to 47 5/8; <s>
Intel slipped 1/4 to 33 1/4, <s>
and Valley National Corp. was up 1/8 to 15 1/8. <s>
"The market started with several strikes against it," <s>
said Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, <s>
referring to news <s>
that the labor-management buy-out of UAL Corp. continued to unravel, <s>
and reports <s>
that the junk-bond market is disintegrating. <s>
But the computer-guided selling in response to those developments dealt a serious blow to the over-the-counter market, <s>
Mr. DaPuzzo said. <s>
Even though the over-the-counter market usually doesn't fall by as much as listed stocks during program-selling blitzes, <s>
he said, <s>
"when the market does recover, <s>
the damage is done <s>
and it leaves Nasdaq down more than the Big Board." <s>
Mr. DaPuzzo also complained <s>
that the sharp swings in stock prices lately is scaring away retail and foreign investors. <s>
While Shearson doesn't do computer-guided program trading for its own account, <s>
the firm does execute orders for clients <s>
involved in the buying and selling of shares <s>
tied to movements in certain stock indexes, <s>
Mr. DaPuzzo acknowledged. <s>
The volatility inherent in program trading troubled other traders, too. <s>
They don't like the risks <s>
they are forced to assume <s>
when prices swing so drastically. <s>
Market makers are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand <s>
to maintain orderly trading <s>
when imbalances occur. <s>
That means that on days <s>
when prices are tumbling <s>
and sellers abound <s>
they must be willing to buy shares from sellers <s>
when no one else will. <s>
In such an environment, a market maker can absorb huge losses. <s>
But the recent volatility in stock prices <s>
caused by the program trading <s>
has made some market makers less willing to soak up the stocks <s>
that are for sale. <s>
The market makers say <s>
they aren't comfortable carrying big positions in stocks <s>
because they realize <s>
prices can tumble quickly. <s>
The situation makes it harder to buy and sell shares quickly, <s>
exacerbating the rise and fall in stock prices during program-dominated trading. <s>
Groused Robert Antolini, head of over-the-counter trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette: <s>
"It's making it tough for traders to make money." <s>
He said <s>
that when sell programs kick in, <s>
many traders believe <s>
that "there's no sense in sticking your nose out <s>
because you're an instant loser." <s>
Kinder-Care Learning Centers added 1/4 to 4 7/8 on 461,200 shares. <s>
Lodestar Group said <s>
it will make a $6-a-share offer for the remaining Kinder-Care Learning Center common stock <s>
if it acquires a majority of the company's shares in a pending rights offering by Kinder-Care Learning Center's parent, Kinder-Care Inc. <s>
Shares of KinderCare Inc. closed at 3 1/2, also up 1/4, on volume of 700,000. <s>
Ohio Casualty dropped 2 1/8 to 49 1/2. <s>
The company posted third-quarter earnings of 95 cents a share, down from $1.26 a year earlier. <s>
The company estimated <s>
that losses from Hurricane Hugo reduced net income by 32 cents a share in the most recent quarter. <s>
The company said <s>
losses from the Oct. 17 earthquake in California haven't yet been determined, <s>
but that it provides earthquake coverage to about 1,400 properties in the stricken area. <s>

the company said. <s>
North Atlantic Industries jumped 1 to 5 3/4. <s>
The electronics-instruments maker is to be acquired by Asset Management Associates for $7.25 a share. <s>
LIN Broadcasting slid 1 3/8 to 108 3/4, <s>
despite reporting third-quarter net of 46 cents a share, up from 39 cents the previous year. <s>
The company said <s>
the latest quarter included about $3.4 million in special legal and financial advisory costs <s>
related to McCaw Cellular Communications' bid for the company and LIN's merger pact with BellSouth. <s>
McCaw was unchanged at 40. <s>
XL/Datacomp slid 2 1/4 to 16 1/2 amid continuing concerns about the company's contract negotiations with International Business Machines. <s>
IBM is reviewing its entire business-partners program, <s>
and XL/Datacomp confirmed earlier this month <s>
that it was in talks with the company about possible modifications to its current IBM-remarketer contract. <s>
Remarketers make modifications to IBM's computer hardware <s>
and resell the products. <s>
Omni Capital Group surged 1 3/4 to 16 1/4. <s>
The company said <s>
net rose to 38 cents a share in its fiscal-first quarter <s>
ended Sept. 30, <s>
from 35 cents a shares a year ago. <s>
