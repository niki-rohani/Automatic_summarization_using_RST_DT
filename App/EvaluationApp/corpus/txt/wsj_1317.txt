Just five months after Ogilvy Group was swallowed up in an unsolicited takeover, <s>
Kenneth Roman, Ogilvy's chairman and chief executive officer, said <s>
he is leaving <s>
to take a top post at American Express Co. <s>
Mr. Roman, 59 years old, abruptly announced <s>
he will leave the venerable ad agency, <s>
whose largest client is American Express, <s>
to become American Express's executive vice president for corporate affairs and communications. <s>
He will succeed Harry L. Freeman, 57, <s>
who has said <s>
he will retire in December. <s>
Mr. Freeman said in August <s>
that he would retire by the end of this year <s>
to take "executive responsibility" for an embarrassing effort <s>
to discredit banker Edmond Safra. <s>
American Express representatives apparently influenced the publication of unfavorable articles about Mr. Safra. <s>
The company later apologized <s>
and agreed to make $8 million in contributions to charities <s>
chosen by him. <s>
Although Mr. Freeman is retiring, <s>
he will continue to work as a consultant for American Express on a project basis. <s>
Ad industry executives weren't surprised by Mr. Roman's decision <s>
to leave Ogilvy. <s>
The agency, under his direction, bitterly fought a takeover attempt by WPP Group PLC of London <s>
before succumbing in May. <s>
And <s>
although Mr. Roman and WPP's chief executive, Martin Sorrell, have gone out of their way <s>
to be publicly supportive of each other, <s>
people close to Mr. Roman say <s>
he was unhappy giving up control of the company. <s>
Some executives also cite tension <s>
because of efforts by Mr. Sorrell, a financial man, <s>
to cut costs at the agency. <s>
Mr. Roman will be succeeded as the head of Ogilvy's flagship ad agency, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, by Graham Phillips, 50, <s>
who had been president of North American operations <s>
and who, like Mr. Sorrell, is British. <s>
Alexander Brody, 56, will take on the newly created position of president of the world-wide agency and chief executive of its international operations. <s>
He had been president of the international operations. <s>
Mr. Roman also had overseen Ogilvy Group's two other units, the Scali McCabe Sloves advertising agency and its research division, <s>
but those units will now report directly to WPP. <s>
Mr. Roman appears custom-made for the American Express job. <s>
Known as a traditional executive, <s>
he is very much in the conservative American Express mold. <s>
Moreover, after 26 years at Ogilvy he had honed a reputation <s>
for being squeaky-clean and a straight arrow <s>
-- which can only help American Express in the wake of the Safra incident. <s>
He also is close to American Express's chairman and chief executive officer, James D. Robinson III. <s>
Aside from working with Mr. Robinson on the American Express advertising account for about 11 years, <s>
Mr. Roman serves on several of the same charities and boards as Mr. Robinson. <s>
The abrupt management change sparked widespread speculation <s>
that Mr. Roman had been pushed out of Ogilvy's top spot by Mr. Sorrell. <s>
But Mr. Roman flatly denied the speculation, <s>
saying <s>
Mr. Sorrell had tried several times to persuade him to stay, <s>
offering various incentives <s>
and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine <s>
(The wine, naturally, was Seagram's brand, an Ogilvy client). <s>
"He asked me not to resign. <s>
The implication <s>
that I was pushed aside <s>
wouldn't be accurate," <s>
Mr. Roman said. <s>
Mr. Sorrell, <s>
traveling in the Far East, <s>
couldn't be reached. <s>
Mr. Roman said <s>
American Express's Mr. Robinson first approached him about the job in late September. <s>
According to industry executives, <s>
Peter Sutherland, a former European Community commissioner from Ireland, was also a serious contender for the American Express job. <s>
Although it ultimately wasn't offered to him, <s>
he will be on retainer to American Express as an adviser on international matters. <s>
After talking on and off for the past four weeks, <s>
Mr. Roman said, <s>
he agreed to take the job <s>
because "it's the right time, <s>
it's a terrific opportunity, <s>
and I think <s>
I leave the company in very strong hands. <s>
It was my decision, not anyone else's." <s>
Mr. Roman also brushed aside reports about infighting between him and Mr. Phillips, his successor at Ogilvy. <s>
The two executives could hardly be more different. <s>
Mr. Roman comes across as a low-key executive; <s>
Mr. Phillips has a flashier personality. <s>
During time off, Mr. Roman tends to his garden; <s>
Mr. Phillips confesses to a fondness for, among other things, fast cars and planes. <s>
Industry executives say <s>
that <s>
although the two executives used to clash more frequently, <s>
the WPP takeover brought them closer together. <s>
"I'm the guy <s>
who made him head of New York, head of the U.S., president of North America, <s>
and recommended him {to Mr. Sorrell} as my successor. <s>
Would I have done all those things successively <s>
if I didn't think <s>
he was the right guy?" <s>
Mr. Roman asked. <s>
He labeled reports of friction "ridiculous," <s>
and said <s>
that he spent part of the weekend on Mr. Phillips's boat in Connecticut. <s>
Mr. Roman will oversee American Express's public relations and government affairs, among other things, <s>
but he won't be involved in its advertising, <s>
which is handled by the operating units. <s>
"I consider this a second career," <s>
he said. <s>
He also will sit on the company's corporate planning and policy committee, <s>
made up of the top corporate and operating executives. <s>
Mr. Roman's departure isn't expected to have any enormous repercussions at Ogilvy. <s>
American Express, Kraft General Foods, and Mattel executives said <s>
the move won't affect their relationships with the ad agency. <s>
"General Foods's relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies' work, <s>
and will continue to be," <s>
said David Hurwitt, a vice president of Kraft General Foods. <s>
But some clients and analysts expressed concern <s>
that Mr. Phillips isn't as well-known to many clients. <s>
"Ken was my key contact," <s>
said J. Nicholas Hahn, president and chief executive officer of Cotton Inc., <s>
which represents cotton producers. <s>
"I don't know {Mr. Phillips} all that well. <s>
I haven't seen or talked to him in several years." <s>
And some analysts questioned <s>
whether Mr. Phillips would have the skills <s>
Ogilvy needs <s>
to turn the agency around. <s>
While the agency has done well in many parts of the world, <s>
its flagship New York office has had a dismal track record recently; <s>
it has won few new accounts <s>
while losing big ones, <s>
including Maxwell House. <s>
"I think <s>
{Mr. Phillips} is going to need some help. <s>
I think <s>
they need creative leadership, <s>
and I don't think <s>
they have it," <s>
said Emma Hill, an analyst with Wertheim & Co. <s>
Ogilvy & Mather's top creative executive, Norman Berry, left the agency earlier this year. <s>
"Norm Berry was a creative inspiration at the company, <s>
and nobody has filled that void," <s>
said Ms. Hill. <s>
But other analysts said <s>
that having Mr. Phillips succeed Mr. Roman would make for a smooth transition. <s>
"Graham Phillips has been there a long time, <s>
knows the culture well, <s>
is aggressive, <s>
and apparently gets along well with" Mr. Sorrell, <s>
said Andrew Wallach, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert. <s>
"It's probably a reasonable transition. <s>
Hopefully, he'll be the answer to the problems <s>
they've had in New York." <s>
Sale of Saatchi Unit Close <s>
Computer Sciences Corp., El Segundo, Calif., said <s>
it is close to making final an agreement <s>
to buy Cleveland Consulting Associates from Saatchi & Saatchi <s>
Computer Sciences wouldn't disclose the proposed purchase price for Cleveland Consulting, <s>
which counsels companies on logistics and supply. <s>
But David Lord, managing editor of Consultants News, an industry publication <s>
based in Fitzwilliam, N.H., <s>
said <s>
an industry standard would suggest a purchase price of between one and two times Cleveland Consulting's approximately $15 million annual revenue. <s>
Both Saatchi & Saatchi, <s>
which announced its intention <s>
to sell off most of its consulting business in June, <s>
and Cleveland Consulting declined to comment on the proposed sale. <s>
Ad Notes. . . . <s>
NEW ACCOUNT: <s>
AmBase Corp., New York, awarded the ad account for its Home Insurance Co. unit to Biederman, Kelly & Shaffer, New York. <s>
Billings weren't disclosed. . . . <s>
Puerto Rico Telephone Co. awarded its $3 million account to West Indies & Grey, Grey Advertising's office in Puerto Rico. <s>
DIET COKE: <s>
Coca-Cola Co. yesterday said <s>
singer Elton John signed <s>
to appear in an ad for Diet Coke. <s>
Details of the commercial, <s>
which will be part of the brand's 1990 advertising campaign, <s>
weren't disclosed. <s>
Mr. John becomes the latest of many music stars, <s>
including George Michael and Whitney Houston, <s>
to appear in ads for the diet drink. <s>
