CHICAGO - <s>
Sears, Roebuck & Co. is struggling <s>
as it enters the critical Christmas season. <s>
Yesterday, the retailing and financial services giant reported a 16% drop in third-quarter earnings to $257.5 million, or 75 cents a share, from a restated $305 million, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier. <s>
But the news was even worse for Sears's core U.S. retailing operation, the largest in the nation. <s>
Sears said <s>
its U.S. stores had a loss of $6.9 million, their first deficit for the period in more than five years. <s>
Analysts estimated <s>
that sales at U.S. stores declined in the quarter, too. <s>
The results underscore Sears's difficulties <s>
in implementing the "everyday low pricing" strategy <s>
that it adopted in March as part of a broad attempt <s>
to revive its retailing business. <s>
Under the new approach, Sears set prices <s>
that were somewhere between its old "regular" and "sale" prices. <s>
The company said <s>
it would resort far less often to slashing prices <s>
to woo shoppers. <s>
Sears officials insist <s>
they don't intend to abandon the everyday pricing approach in the face of the poor results. <s>
Instead, a spokesman blames the dismal third-quarter showing on "an environment <s>
that is being distorted by a very harsh climate for sales of durable goods," <s>
which account for roughly two-thirds of Sears's annual merchandise volume. <s>
The new pricing strategy "is working," <s>
the spokesman asserted. <s>
He added <s>
that, <s>
after an initial surge <s>
triggered by an advertising blitz in March, <s>
Sears expected <s>
that the pricing program wouldn't have any effect on revenue. <s>
Sears has been counting on growth <s>
coming from the large displays of brand-name merchandise <s>
it is adding to its stores over the next two years <s>
in what it calls "power formats." <s>
But analysts say <s>
Sears faces an especially daunting challenge on the eve of the Christmas shopping season. <s>
"I believe <s>
everyday pricing in the current environment doesn't work," <s>
says Walter Loeb of Morgan Stanley & Co., <s>
pointing to soft durable-goods sales. <s>
"Sears is likely to be unsuccessful <s>
if it continues with its pricing policy <s>
when everyone else is offering unusual values." <s>
In what amounts to an admission <s>
that the transition hasn't gone as smoothly <s>
as Sears had hoped, <s>
the giant retailer is now trying new ways <s>
to drum up business <s>
without appearing to abandon its seven-month-old strategy. <s>
The company is highlighting more special deals in its advertising and stores, <s>
and it's offering to defer finance charges on certain big-ticket items. <s>
Sears is also stepping up its television ads <s>
and changing its message. <s>
In a new TV ad, for instance, a woman <s>
going through the Sunday newspaper <s>
brands as hype claims by other stores <s>
that they are offering goods for "50%, 60% and 70% off." <s>
By lowering prices throughout its stores, <s>
she says, <s>
"Sears has the right idea." <s>
But the ad also mentions Sears's sales <s>
-- a topic <s>
that the retailer has avoided <s>
since switching to everyday pricing. <s>
"When Sears has a sale at a special price," <s>
the woman in the ad declares, <s>
"it's something <s>
you don't want to miss." <s>
Recent surveys by Leo J. Shapiro & Associates, a market research firm in Chicago, suggest <s>
that Sears is having a tough time <s>
attracting shoppers <s>
because it hasn't yet done enough <s>
to improve service or its selection of merchandise. <s>
The number of people <s>
who said <s>
they were more likely to shop at Sears <s>
fell in September to 37% from 66% in March, <s>
when Sears blanketed the airwaves with ads about its new pricing strategy. <s>
Moreover, the number of people <s>
who spontaneously cited lower prices as the reason for their interest in Sears <s>
declined to 16% in September from 33% in March. <s>
Just 5% of the respondents mentioned brands in September, up slightly from 2% in March. <s>
Only 2% of the people in September cited Sears's "friendly personnel." <s>
"The power of price as an appeal, <s>
which was very considerable in driving traffic in March and April, <s>
has diminished," <s>
says George Rosenbaum, president of Shapiro & Associates. <s>
"You see some improvement in these other areas, <s>
but it's a very small and slow process." <s>
For the third quarter, <s>
Sears said <s>
its total revenue rose 4.8% to $13.18 billion from $12.57 billion a year earlier. <s>
Net income at Sears's merchandise group, <s>
which includes international and credit card operations, as well as U.S. stores, <s>
fell 25%. <s>
Profit at Sears's Allstate insurance unit fell 38% to $126.1 million <s>
because of Hurricane Hugo, <s>
which inflicted the greatest single storm damage loss in the company's history. <s>
Sears said <s>
claims from the storm, <s>
as expected, <s>
reduced its third-quarter net by $80 million, or 23 cents a share. <s>
Allstate is expected to absorb another big hit in the fourth quarter <s>
as claims pour in from the San Francisco earthquake. <s>
But a spokesman said <s>
the quake won't have as big a financial impact on Allstate <s>
as Hurricane Hugo did. <s>
Net income at Sears's Dean Witter Financials Services group, meanwhile, rose nearly 32% to $35.7 million, <s>
reflecting improvements in its basic stock brokerage and Discover credit card businesses. <s>
Profit at Sears's Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group nearly quadrupled to $81.2 million <s>
because of gains on sales of property. <s>
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Sears shares closed at $40.50, up 87.5 cents. <s>
