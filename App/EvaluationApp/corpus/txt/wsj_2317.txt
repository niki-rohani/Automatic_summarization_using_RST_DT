Elcotel Inc. expects fiscal second-quarter earnings to trail 1988 results, <s>
but anticipates <s>
that several new products will lead to a "much stronger" performance in its second half. <s>
Elcotel, a telecommunications company, had net income of $272,000, or five cents a share, in its year-earlier second quarter, <s>
ended Sept. 30. <s>
Revenue totaled $5 million. <s>
George Pierce, chairman and chief executive officer, said in an interview <s>
that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under $4 million <s>
. The lower results, <s>
Mr. Pierce said, <s>
reflect a 12-month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones, Elcotel's primary business. <s>
Although Mr. Pierce expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year, <s>
he said <s>
Elcotel will also benefit from moving into other areas. <s>
Foremost among those is the company's entrance into the public facsimile business, <s>
Mr. Pierce said. <s>
Within the next year, Elcotel expects to place 10,000 fax machines, <s>
made by Minolta in Japan, in hotels, municipal buildings, drugstores and other public settings around the country. <s>
Elcotel will provide a credit-card reader for the machines <s>
to collect, store and forward billing data. <s>
Mr. Pierce said <s>
Elcotel should realize a minimum of $10 of recurring net earnings for each machine each month. <s>
Elcotel has also developed an automatic call processor <s>
that will make further use of the company's system <s>
for automating and handling credit-card calls and collect calls. <s>
Automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone, <s>
Mr. Pierce said, <s>
not just phones <s>
produced by Elcotel. <s>
The company will also be producing a new line of convenience telephones, <s>
which don't accept coins, <s>
for use in hotel lobbies, office lobbies, hospitality lounges and similar settings. <s>
Mr. Pierce estimated <s>
that the processors and convenience phones would produce about $5 of recurring net earnings for each machine each month. <s>
