The Bush administration,<s> 
trying to blunt growing demands from Western Europe for a relaxation of controls on exports to the Soviet bloc,<s> 
is questioning<s> 
whether Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti & Co. supplied militarily valuable technology to the Soviets.<s> 
Most of the Western European members of Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, the unofficial forum<s> 
through which the U.S. and its allies align their export-control policies,<s> 
are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting<s> 
to be held in Paris Oct. 25 and 26.<s> 
They plan to press specifically for a relaxation of rules<s> 
governing exports of machine tools, computers and other high-technology products.<s> 
But the Bush administration says<s> 
it wants to see evidence<s> 
that all Cocom members are complying fully with existing export-control procedures<s> 
before it will support further liberalization.<s> 
To make its point,<s> 
it is challenging the Italian government to explain reports<s> 
that Olivetti may have supplied the Soviet Union with sophisticated computer-driven devices<s> 
that could be used<s> 
to build parts for combat aircraft.<s> 
The London Sunday Times,<s> 
which first reported the U.S. concerns,<s> 
cited a U.S. intelligence report as the source of the allegations<s> 
that Olivetti exported $25 million in "embargoed, state-of-the-art, flexible manufacturing systems to the Soviet aviation industry."<s> 
Olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in 1984.<s> 
A State Department spokesman acknowledged<s> 
that the U.S. is discussing the allegations with the Italian government and Cocom,<s> 
but declined to confirm any details.<s> 
Italian President Francesco Cossiga promised a quick investigation<s> 
into whether Olivetti broke Cocom rules.<s> 
President Bush called his attention to the matter during the Italian leader's visit here last week.<s> 
Olivetti has denied<s> 
that it violated Cocom rules,<s> 
asserting<s> 
that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the Italian authorities.<s> 
Although the legality of these sales is still an open question,<s> 
the disclosure couldn't be better timed<s> 
to support the position of export-control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community.<s> 
"It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important Cocom meeting,"<s> 
said a Washington lobbyist for a number of U.S. computer companies.<s> 
The Bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export-control policies,<s> 
reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies.<s> 
Last summer, Mr. Bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization<s> 
when he told a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting<s> 
that he would allow some exceptions to the Cocom embargo of strategic goods.<s> 
But more recently, the Pentagon and the Commerce Department openly feuded over the extent<s> 
to which Cocom should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc.<s> 
However, these agencies generally agree<s> 
that the West should be cautious about any further liberalization.<s> 
"There's no evidence<s> 
that the Soviet program<s> 
to<s> 
(illegally)<s> 
acquire Western technology<s> 
has diminished,"<s> 
said a State Department spokesman.
