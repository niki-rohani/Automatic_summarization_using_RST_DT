RJR Nabisco Inc. is disbanding its division responsible for buying network advertising time, <s>
just a month after moving 11 of the group's 14 employees to New York from Atlanta. <s>
A spokesman for the New York-based food and tobacco giant, <s>
taken private earlier this year in a $25 billion leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., <s>
confirmed <s>
that it is shutting down the RJR Nabisco Broadcast unit, <s>
and dismissing its 14 employees, in a move <s>
to save money. <s>
The spokesman said <s>
RJR is discussing its network-buying plans with its two main advertising firms, FCB/Leber Katz and McCann Erickson. <s>
"We found with the size of our media purchases <s>
that an ad agency could do just as good a job at significantly lower cost," <s>
said the spokesman, <s>
who declined to specify <s>
how much RJR spends on network television time. <s>
An executive close to the company said <s>
RJR is spending about $140 million on network television time this year, down from roughly $200 million last year. <s>
The spokesman said <s>
the broadcast unit will be disbanded Dec. 1, <s>
and the move won't affect RJR's print, radio and spot-television buying practices. <s>
The broadcast group had been based in New York until a year ago, <s>
when RJR's previous management moved it to Atlanta, the company's headquarters before this summer. <s>
One employee with the group said <s>
RJR moved 11 employees of the group back to New York in September <s>
because "there was supposed to be a future." <s>
He said <s>
the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks, <s>
wooing them from jobs with advertising agencies. <s>
The RJR spokesman said <s>
the company moved the 11 employees to New York last month <s>
because the group had then been in the midst <s>
of purchasing ad time for the networks' upcoming season. <s>
"The studies <s>
{on closing the unit} <s>
couldn't be completed until now," <s>
he said. <s>
The group's president, Peter Chrisanthopoulos, wasn't in his office Friday afternoon <s>
to comment. <s>
