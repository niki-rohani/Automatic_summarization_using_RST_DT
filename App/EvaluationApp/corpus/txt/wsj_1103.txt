Boston Co., the upper-crust financial services concern <s>
that was rocked by a management scandal late last year, <s>
has had a sharp drop in profitability <s>
-- mainly because a high-risk bet on interest rates backfired. <s>
Boston Co. 's fall from grace is bad news for its parent, Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc., <s>
which has relied heavily on the banking and money management unit's contributions in recent years. <s>
In 1988, for example, Boston Co. had an estimated pretax profit of at least $110 million, <s>
while Shearson managed net income of just $96 million. <s>
Shearson doesn't break out the earnings of its subsidiaries. <s>
But people familiar with Boston Co. 's performance say <s>
the unit had profit of around $17 million for the third quarter, <s>
after barely breaking even for the first six months. <s>
Shearson, meanwhile, posted net income of $106 million for the first nine months of the year, down slightly from $110 million for the year-ago period. <s>
Moody's Investors Service Inc. last week downgraded the long-term deposit rating of Boston Co. 's Boston Safe Deposit & Trust Co. subsidiary, to single-A-1 from double-A-3, <s>
citing problems in the company's "aggressively managed securities portfolio." <s>
John Kriz, a Moody's vice president, said <s>
Boston Safe Deposit's performance has been hurt this year by a mismatch in the maturities of its assets and liabilities. <s>
The mismatch exposed the company to a high degree of interest-rate risk, <s>
and <s>
when rates moved unfavorably <s>
-- beginning late last year <s>
and continuing into this year -- <s>
"it cost them," <s>
Mr. Kriz said. <s>
Mr. Kriz noted <s>
that Boston Safe Deposit "has taken some actions <s>
to better control asset-liability management <s>
and improve controls in general, <s>
and we think <s>
these will serve to improve credit quality." <s>
As some securities mature <s>
and the proceeds are reinvested, <s>
the problems ought to ease, <s>
he said. <s>
But he also cited concerns over the company's mortgage exposure in the troubled New England real estate market. <s>
Boston Co. officials declined to comment on Moody's action or on the unit's financial performance this year <s>
-- except to deny a published report <s>
that outside accountants had discovered evidence of significant accounting errors in the first three quarters' results. <s>
An accounting controversy at the end of last year forced Boston Co. to admit <s>
it had overstated pretax profits by some $44 million. <s>
The resulting scandal led to the firing of James N. von Germeten as Boston Co. 's president and to the resignations of the company's chief financial officer and treasurer. <s>
The executives were accused of improperly deferring expenses and booking revenue early, in an effort <s>
to dress up results <s>
-- and perhaps bolster performance-related bonuses. <s>
Mr. von Germeten, in turn, attributed the controversy to judgmental errors by accountants <s>
and accused Shearson of conducting a "witch hunt." <s>
Mr. Kriz of Moody's said <s>
the problems in the securities portfolio stem largely from positions <s>
taken last year. <s>
The company's current management found itself "locked into this," <s>
he said. <s>
