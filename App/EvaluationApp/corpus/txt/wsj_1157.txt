Insiders have been selling shares in Dun & Bradstreet Corp., the huge credit-information concern. <s>
Six top executives at the New York-based company sold shares in August and September. <s>
Four of those insiders sold more than half their holdings. <s>
The stock, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, closed at $51.75, up 62.5 cents, well below the $56.13 to $60 a share <s>
the insiders received for their shares. <s>
Much of the recent slide in Dun & Bradstreet's stock came late last week, after negative comments by analysts at Merrill Lynch & Co. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. <s>
A company spokesman declined to comment <s>
and said <s>
that the officials <s>
who sold shares <s>
wouldn't comment. <s>
One of Dun & Bradstreet's chief businesses is compiling reports <s>
that rate the credit-worthiness of millions of American companies. <s>
It also owns Moody's Investors Service, <s>
which assigns credit-ratings to bonds and preferred stock; <s>
A.C. Nielsen, <s>
known for its data on television-viewing patterns, <s>
and Yellow-pages publisher Donnelley. <s>
Last March, this newspaper reported on widespread allegations <s>
that the company misled many customers into purchasing more credit-data services than needed. <s>
In June, the company agreed to settle for $18 million several lawsuits <s>
related to its sales practices, <s>
without admitting or denying the charges. <s>
An investigation by U.S. Postal inspectors is continuing. <s>
Among the insider sales, Charles Raikes, the firm's general counsel, sold 12,281 shares in August, <s>
representing 46% of his holdings in the company. <s>
He received $724,579 for the shares, <s>
according to insider filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. <s>
John C. Holt, an executive vice president and Dun & Bradstreet director, sold 10,000 shares on Aug. 31 for $588,800, <s>
filings show. <s>
He retains 9,232 shares. <s>
William H.J. Buchanan, the firm's secretary and associate general counsel, sold 7,000 shares in two separate sales in September for $406,000. <s>
The shares represented 66% of his Dun & Bradstreet holdings, <s>
according to the company. <s>
The other insiders, all senior or executive vice presidents, sold between 2,520 and 6,881 shares, <s>
representing between 8% and 70% of their holdings, <s>
according to SEC filings. <s>
Dun & Bradstreet's stock price began its recent spiral downward last Wednesday, <s>
when the company reported third-quarter results. <s>
Net income rose to 83 cents a share from 72 cents a share the year-earlier period. <s>
But analysts focused more on the drop in revenue, to $1.04 billion from $1.07 billion, <s>
reflecting in part a continuing drop in sales of the controversial credit-reporting services. <s>
Last Thursday, Merrill Lynch securities analyst Peter Falco downgraded his investment rating on the firm, <s>
according to Dow Jones Professional Investors Report, <s>
citing a slowdown in the credit-reporting business. <s>
He cut his rating to a short-term hold from above-average performer <s>
and reduced his 1990 earnings estimate. <s>
Mr. Falco continues to rank the stock a longterm buy. <s>
The stock slid $1.875 on more than four times average daily volume. <s>
The stock received another blow on Friday, <s>
when Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Philo advised <s>
that investors with short-term horizons should avoid Dun & Bradstreet stock <s>
because it is unlikely to outperform the market. <s>
The stock fell 75 cents. <s>
Insider selling is not unusual at Dun & Bradstreet; <s>
in fact, the recent pace of selling is just about average for the company, <s>
according to figures <s>
compiled by Invest/Net, a North Miami, Fla., firm <s>
that specializes in tracking and analyzing SEC insider filings. <s>
But previous sales have often been sales of shares <s>
purchased through the exercise of stock options <s>
and sold six months later, <s>
as soon as allowed, <s>
said Robert Gabele, president of Invest/Net. <s>
The most recent sales don't appear to be option-related, <s>
he said. <s>
TASTY PROFITS: <s>
Michael A. Miles, chief executive officer of Philip Morris Cos. ' Kraft General Foods unit, bought 6,000 shares of the company on Sept. 22 for $157 each. <s>
The $942,000 purchase raised his holdings to 74,000 shares. <s>
The stock split four-for-one on Oct. 10. <s>
Mr. Miles's newly purchased shares are now worth $1,068,000, <s>
based on Philip Morris's closing price of $44.50, up 62.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. <s>
A spokesman for Mr. Miles said <s>
he bought the shares <s>
because he felt <s>
they were "a good investment." <s>
The executive made his purchases <s>
shortly before being named to his current chief executive officer's position; <s>
formerly he was Kraft General Foods' chief operating officer. <s>
SHEDDING GLITTER: <s>
Two directors of Pegasus Gold Inc., a Spokane, Wash., precious-metals mining firm, sold most of their holdings in the company Aug. 31. <s>
John J. Crabb sold 4,500 shares for $11.13 each, <s>
leaving himself with a stake of 500 shares. <s>
He received $50,085. <s>
Peter Kutney sold 5,000 shares, all of his holdings, for $11.38 a share, or $56,900. <s>
Gary Straub, corporate counsel for the company, said <s>
the directors sold for "personal financial reasons." <s>
Both insiders declined to comment. <s>
On Wall Street, Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Daniel A. Roling rates the stock "neutral" <s>
and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. lists it as a "buy." <s>
Pegasus Gold "has been on a lot of recommended lists as a junior growth company <s>
stepping into the big leagues," <s>
says Marty McNeill, metals analyst at Dominick & Dominick, a New York investment firm. <s>
"It's a good company, <s>
and growing; <s>
there's nothing <s>
that would warrant that it be sold." <s>
Yesterday, in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange, Pegasus closed at $10.125, up 12.5 cents. <s>
