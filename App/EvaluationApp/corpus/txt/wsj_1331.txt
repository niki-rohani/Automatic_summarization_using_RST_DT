GAF, Part III is scheduled to begin today. <s>
After two mistrials, the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of GAF Corp. and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, have changed considerably. <s>
The first two GAF trials were watched closely on Wall Street <s>
because they were considered to be important tests of the government's ability <s>
to convince a jury of allegations <s>
stemming from its insider-trading investigations. <s>
In an eight-count indictment, the government charged GAF, a Wayne, N.J., chemical maker, and Mr. Sherwin with illegally attempting to manipulate the common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF's planned sale of a large block of the stock in 1986. <s>
The government's credibility in the GAF case depended heavily on its star witness, Boyd L. Jefferies, the former Los Angeles brokerage chief <s>
who was implicated by former arbitrager Ivan Boesky, <s>
and then pointed the finger at Mr. Sherwin, takeover speculator Salim B. Lewis and corporate raider Paul Bilzerian. <s>
The GAF trials were viewed as previews of the government's strength in its cases against Mr. Lewis and Mr. Bilzerian. <s>
Mr. Jefferies's performance as a witness was expected to affect his sentencing. <s>
But GAF's bellwether role was short-lived. <s>
The first GAF trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks <s>
when U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe found <s>
that a prosecutor improperly, but unintentionally, withheld a document. <s>
After 93 hours of deliberation, the jurors in the second trial said <s>
they were hopelessly deadlocked, <s>
and another mistrial was declared on March 22. <s>
Meanwhile, a federal jury found Mr. Bilzerian guilty on securities fraud and other charges in June. <s>
A month later, Mr. Jefferies was spared a jail term by a federal judge <s>
who praised him <s>
for helping the government. <s>
In August, Mr. Lewis pleaded guilty to three felony counts. <s>
Nevertheless, the stakes are still high for the players <s>
directly involved in the GAF case. <s>
The mistrials have left the reputations of GAF, Mr. Sherwin and GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman in limbo. <s>
For Mr. Sherwin, a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each count. <s>
GAF faces potential fines of $500,000 for each count. <s>
Individuals familiar with the case said <s>
that throughout September, defense attorneys were talking with the government in an effort <s>
to prevent a trial, <s>
but by the end of the month the talks had ended. <s>
There is much speculation among attorneys <s>
not involved <s>
that the strategy of GAF's attorney, Arthur Liman, and Mr. Sherwin's counsel, Stephen Kaufman, will include testimony by Mr. Sherwin or Mr. Heyman. <s>
Neither testified at the previous trials. <s>
For now, defense attorneys are tight-lipped about their plans. <s>
Max Gitter, another GAF defense attorney, said yesterday, <s>
"As we go in for the third time, <s>
Yogi Berra's famous line is apt: <s>
`It's deja vu all over again. '" <s>
DALKON SHIELD CLAIMANTS hope to stop reorganization-plan appeal. <s>
Attorneys for more than 18,000 women <s>
who claim injuries from the Dalkon Shield contraceptive device <s>
have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to refuse to hear an appeal of the bankruptcy-law reorganization plan for A.H. Robins Co., <s>
which manufactured the device. <s>
The dispute pits two groups of claimants against each other. <s>
Baltimore attorney Michael A. Pretl and 17 other attorneys <s>
representing 18,136 claimants in the U.S. and abroad <s>
argue <s>
that the appeal would delay <s>
-- and perhaps even destroy -- <s>
a $2.38 billion settlement fund <s>
that is the centerpiece of the reorganization plan. <s>
The bankruptcy-court reorganization is being challenged before the Supreme Court by a dissident group of claimants <s>
because it places a cap on the total amount of money available <s>
to settle claims. <s>
It also bars future suits against Robins company officials, members of the Robins family and Robins's former insurer, Aetna Life & Casualty Co. <s>
The latter provision is "legally unprecedented," <s>
said Alan B. Morrison, a public interest lawyer in Washington, D.C., <s>
who is challenging the plan on behalf of 900 claimants. <s>
More than 100,000 claims against Robins are pending. <s>
The company made and marketed the Dalkon Shield in the early 1970s amid mounting evidence <s>
that it could cause serious injuries. <s>
Robins has been in proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since August 1985; <s>
such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits <s>
while it works out a plan for paying its debts. <s>
American Home Products Corp. wants to acquire Robins, <s>
but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted. <s>
In a brief <s>
filed with the Supreme Court last week, <s>
Mr. Pretl criticizes the appeal <s>
for raising "abstract" and "theoretical" legal issues, <s>
while jeopardizing the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants. <s>
The Supreme Court is scheduled to consider the case Nov. 3 <s>
and may issue a decision as early as Nov. 6. <s>
JURY`S CRIMINAL CONVICTION under Superfund law is a first. <s>
Charles A. Donohoo, sole proprieter of a Louisville, Ky., demolition company, was found guilty of violating the Superfund law as well as the Clean Air Act. <s>
Criminal convictions under the federal Superfund law are rare, <s>
and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case. <s>
Under Superfund, those <s>
who owned, generated or transported hazardous waste <s>
are liable for its cleanup, <s>
regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time. <s>
Environmental lawyers say <s>
virtually all of the Superfund cases to date have involved civil penalties <s>
designed to insure cleanup of past polluting activities. <s>
But Superfund also contains a criminal provision <s>
concerning the release of toxic substances into the environment. <s>
In 1986 Congress strengthened the penalty <s>
by making it a felony. <s>
Mr. Donohoo was convicted in Louisville late last month of violating Superfund <s>
by failing to report the release of asbestos into the environment from a building <s>
he was demolishing. <s>
He was also convicted of failing to properly remove asbestos from the building, a violation of the Clean Air Act. <s>
The government sought a criminal penalty <s>
because "no cleanup is possible here. <s>
Once {asbestos} is released into the environment, <s>
it can lodge anywhere," <s>
says Richard A. Dennis, the assistant U.S. attorney <s>
who prosecuted the case. <s>
Mr. Donohoo is scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 11. <s>
His lawyer could not be reached for comment. <s>
Mr. Donohoo faces as much as three years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the Superfund conviction and as much as one year in prison and a $100,000 fine for the violation of the Clean Air Act. <s>
TED BUNDY'S LAWYERS switch to victims' side in death-sentence case. <s>
Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, the Washington, D.C., law firm <s>
that spent over $1 million <s>
fighting the execution of mass-murderer Ted Bundy <s>
-- who eventually was executed -- <s>
has taken on another death penalty case before the Supreme Court, this time on the side of the family of four murder victims in Arkansas. <s>
The law firm has filed a friend-of-the-court brief jointly with the Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group. <s>
The key issue in the case, <s>
which the law firm is handling without a fee, or pro bono, <s>
is whether a person <s>
sentenced to death <s>
can voluntarily waive his rights of appellate review. <s>
The murderer, Ronald Gene Simmons, was convicted of killing 14 people. <s>
Another murderer on death row has appealed Mr. Simmons's death sentence in a "next friend" capacity. <s>
Wilmer Cutler's brief argues <s>
that there is no mandatory appellate review of capital sentences <s>
and that the inmate <s>
who filed the appeal <s>
lacks proper standing. <s>
P.J. Mode, Wilmer Cutler's managing partner, says <s>
the trial team <s>
that represented Mr. Bundy <s>
was asked by the firm's pro bono committee <s>
whether the new case posed a conflict <s>
and that no objections were raised. <s>
The coupling of the law firm and the Washington Legal Foundation is odd also, <s>
because Wilmer Cutler was one of the firms <s>
singled out for criticism two years ago by the conservative legal group <s>
for displaying a liberal bias in its pro bono work. <s>
"We give them a lot of credit <s>
for taking this case," <s>
says WLF's Alan Slobodin. <s>
THE CASE OF THE FAKE DALIS: <s>
In federal court in Manhattan, three defendants pleaded guilty to charges of fraud in connection with the sale of fake Salvador Dali lithographs. <s>
James Burke and Larry Evans, formerly owners of the now-defunct Barclay Gallery, and Prudence Clark, a Barclay sales representative, were charged with conducting high-pressure telephone sales <s>
in which they misrepresented cheap copies of Dali artwork as signed, limited-edition lithographs. <s>
The posters were sold for $1,300 to $6,000, <s>
although the government says <s>
they had a value of only $53 to $200 apiece. <s>
Henry Pitman, the assistant U.S. attorney <s>
handling the case, <s>
said <s>
about 1,000 customers were defrauded <s>
and that Barclay's total proceeds from the sales were $3.4 million. <s>
Attorneys for Messrs. Burke and Evans and Ms. Clarke said <s>
that <s>
although their clients admitted to making some misrepresentations in the sales, <s>
they had believed <s>
that the works were authorized by Mr. Dali, <s>
who died in January. <s>
The posters were printed on paper <s>
pre-signed by Mr. Dali, <s>
the attorneys said. <s>
