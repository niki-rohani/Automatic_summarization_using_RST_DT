Short interest in Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks rose 6% as of mid-October, its biggest jump since 6.3% last April. <s>
The most recent OTC short interest statistics were compiled Oct. 13, the day <s>
the Nasdaq composite index slid 3% <s>
and the New York Stock Exchange tumbled 7%. <s>
The coincidence might lead to the conclusion <s>
that short-sellers bet heavily on that day <s>
that OTC stocks would decline further. <s>
As it happens, <s>
the Nasdaq composite did continue to fall for two days after the initial plunge. <s>
However, the short interest figures <s>
reported by brokerage and securities clearing firms to the National Association of Securities Dealers <s>
include only those trades <s>
completed, or settled, by Oct. 13, rather than trades <s>
that occurred on that day, <s>
according to Gene Finn, chief economist for the NASD. <s>
Generally, it takes five business days to transfer stock and to take the other steps <s>
necessary to settle a trade. <s>
The total short interest in Nasdaq stocks as of mid-October was 237.1 million shares, up from 223.7 million in September but well below the record level of 279 million shares <s>
established in July 1987. <s>
The sharp rise in OTC short interest compares with the 4.2% decline in short interest on the New York Stock Exchange and the 3% rise on the American Stock Exchange during the September-October period. <s>
Generally, a short seller expects a fall in a stock's price <s>
and aims to profit <s>
by selling borrowed shares <s>
that are to be replaced later; <s>
the short seller hopes <s>
the replacement shares <s>
bought later <s>
will cost less than those <s>
that were sold. <s>
Short interest, <s>
which represents the number of shares <s>
borrowed and sold, <s>
but not yet replaced, <s>
can be a bad-expectations barometer for many stocks. <s>
Among 2,412 of the largest OTC issues, short interest rose to 196.8 million shares, from 185.7 million in 2,379 stocks in September. <s>
Big stocks with large short interest gains as of Oct. 13 included First Executive, Intel, Campeau and LIN Broadcasting. <s>
Short interest in First Executive, an insurance issue, rose 55% to 3.8 million. <s>
Intel's short interest jumped 42%, <s>
while Campeau's increased 62%. <s>
Intel makes semiconductors <s>
and Campeau operates department-store chains <s>
and is strained for cash. <s>
Meritor Savings again had the dubious honor <s>
of being the OTC stock with the biggest short interest position on Nasdaq. <s>
Meritor has headed the list since May. <s>
First Executive and troubled Valley National Corp. of Arizona were next in line. <s>
Short selling isn't necessarily bad for the overall market. <s>
Shorted shares must eventually be replaced <s>
through buying. <s>
In addition, changes in short interest in some stocks may be caused by arbitrage. <s>
For example, an investor may seek to profit during some takeover situations <s>
by buying stock in one company involved <s>
and shorting the stock of the other. <s>
Two big stocks <s>
involved in takeover activity <s>
saw their short interest surge. <s>
Short interest in the American depositary receipts of Jaguar, the target of both Ford Motor and General Motors, more than doubled. <s>
Nasdaq stocks <s>
that showed a drop in short interest <s>
included Adobe Systems, Class A shares of Tele-Communications and takeover targets Lyphomed and Jerrico. <s>
The NASD, <s>
which operates the Nasdaq computer system <s>
on which 5,200 OTC issues trade, <s>
compiles short interest data in two categories: <s>
the approximately two-thirds, and generally biggest, Nasdaq stocks <s>
that trade on the National Market System; <s>
and the one-third, and generally smaller, Nasdaq stocks <s>
that aren't a part of the system. <s>
Short interest in 1,327 non-NMS securities totaled 40.3 million shares, <s>
compared with almost 38 million shares in 1,310 issues in September. <s>
The October short interest represents 1.04 days of average daily trading volume in the smaller stocks in the system for the reporting period, <s>
compared with 0.94 day a month ago. <s>
Among bigger OTC stocks, the figures represent 2.05 days of average daily volume, <s>
compared with 2.14 days in September. <s>
The adjacent tables show the issues <s>
in which a short interest position of at least 50,000 shares existed as of Oct. 13 <s>
or in which there was a short position change of at least 25,000 shares since Sept. 15 <s>
(see accompanying tables <s>
-- WSJ Oct. 25, 1989). <s>
